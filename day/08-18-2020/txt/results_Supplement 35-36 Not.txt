Brown’s Conduct did not constitute a substantial disruption of a
critical infrastructure, There is no indication that Brown’s conduct
affecting a portion of Citibank’s operations for a short period of time
could have had a Serious impact on national economic security. As a
result of Brown’s actions, Citibank suffered relatively minor financial
losses and was temporarily unable to optimally serve its customers.
Neither of these harms threatened to disrupt the nation’s economy,
and, in light of Citibank’s demonstrated ability to quickly resolve the
disruption and mitigate in the interim, there is no other evidence that
Brown 's conduct had the potential to do so. Accordingly, we hold that
the district court erred by applying an enhancement that we conclude
1s reserved for conduct that disrupts a critical infrastructure in a way
that could have a serious impact on national economic security.

THE FOURTH AMENDMENT

A. THE REQUIREMENT OF
GOVERNMENT ACTION

On page 399, after Note 4, add the following new note 4.1:

4.1. When reenacting a private search, does it matter whether the officer
conducts the search or asks the private party to do so? Note 4 on page 398
discusses how the Fourth Amendment applies when a private party finds
evidence of crime on a computer and brings the evidence to the police. As Note
4 explains, lower courts are divided on whether and how much the police can
search the computer without a warrant on the ground that they are merely
reconstructing a private search. Now consider another wrinkle: Should the
answer to that question depend on whether the police search the computer
themselves or merely ask the private party to show the police the digital
evidence previously found?

Contrast two recent cases. In the first case, State v. Terrell, 831 S.E.2d 17
(N.C. 2019), the government did the searching. A woman named Ms, Jones
found a suspicious image on her boyfriend’s thumb drive and brought the
thumb drive to the police to investigate. Detective Bailey searched the thumb
drive in order to locate the image Ms. Jones had found. On the way to locating
the suspicious image, the detective observed additional suspicious images. The
Supreme Court of North Carolina ruled that the detective’s search violated the
boyfriend’s Fourth Amendment rights because Ms. Jones’s search of the thumb
drive had been limited in scope:

Following the mere opening of a thumb drive by a private individual,
an officer cannot proceed with “virtual certainty that nothing else of
significance” is in the device “and that a manual inspection of the
[thumb drive] and its contents would not tell him anything more than
he already had been told.” Jacobsen, 466 U.S. at 119. Rather, there
remains the potential for officers to learn any number and all manner
of things that had not previously been learned during the private
search. Accordingly, the extent to which an individual’s expectation
of privacy in the contents of an electronic storage device is frustrated
depends upon the extent of the private search and the nature of the
device and its contents.

It is clear that Ms. Jones’s limited search did not frustrate
defendant’s legitimate expectation of privacy in the entire contents of

THE FOURTH AMENDMENT CH. 5

his thumb drive and that Detective Bailey’s follow-up search to locate
the image of was not permissible under Jacobsen because he did not
possess “a virtual certainty that nothing else of significance was in
the [thumb drive] and that a manual inspection of the [thumb drive]
and its contents would not tell him anything more than he already
had been told” by Jones. Jacobsen, 466 U.S. at 119. The requirement
that an officer possess “virtual certainty that nothing else of
significance” is in a container is central to Jacobsen because the
private-search doctrine, unlike other exceptions to the Fourth
Amendment’s warrant requirement, is premised fundamentally on
the notion that the follow-up search is not a “search” at all. Jacobsen,
466 U.S. at 120 (“It infringed no legitimate expectation of privacy and
hence was not a ‘search’ within the meaning of the Fourth
Amendment.”). If a container continues to support a reasonable
expectation of privacy, it is a necessary corollary that an officer
cannot proceed with a “search” of that container absent virtual
certainty that he will not infringe upon that expectation of privacy.

Id. at 26-27.

Compare Terrell with Commonwealth v. Shaffer, 209 A.3d 957 (Pa. 2019),
a case in which the officer asked the private party to do the search. After a
computer repairman found suspected child pornography on a computer and
brought the computer to the police, the officer asked the repairman to show the
officer exactly what images the repairman had previously seen. The repairman
complied, searching the computer “using the exact route taken to find the
images” previously. Id. at 960. The repairmen then showed the officer the

images he had previously discovered. According to the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court, the officer did not violate the Fourth Amendment. The officer “merely
viewed the images that [the repairman] presented to him,” and therefore he
did not exceed the repairman’s private search. Id. at 974-76.

Does it make sense that these two cases should reach different results?
