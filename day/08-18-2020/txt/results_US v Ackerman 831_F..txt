the contract is to be accorded significance
according to its place in the contract”).
Thus, Item Three’s qualifier doesn’t ren-
der the policy ambiguous.

And this conclusion also controls the
Estate’s second ambiguity argument: ie.,
that the liability limits specified in Item
Three render the Limit of Insurance provi-
sion ambiguous. The Estate points out that
the Limit of Insurance provision limits lia-
bility for any one accident to “the Limit of
Insurance for Liability Coverage shown in
the Declarations.” App. vol. 1, 76 (empha-
sis added). It suggests that it’s unclear
which limit “shown in the Declarations”
this provision refers to. And it argues that
a reasonable insured would understand the
Limit of Insurance provision as referring
to the limits listed in Item Three because
“the Item Two limit would only apply if no
coverage was listed in the column [of Item
Three] relating to coverage.” Aplee. Br. 18
(emphasis added).

But once again, accepting this argument
would require that we read the word
“only” into Item Three’s qualifier. And for
the reasons discussed above, we decline to
do so.

Because Item Three introduces no ambi-
guity into the policy, the New Mexico Su-
preme Court’s Lucero II decision controls.
Specifically, under New Mexico law, we
interpret the ACE policy as establishing
that ACE’s promise to “pay all sums an
‘insured’ legally must pay” remains subject
to, per the Limit of Insurance provision,
“the Limit of Insurance for Liability Cov-
erage shown in the Declarations,” which
includes Item Two’s $1 million-per-acci-
dent limit. See Lucero II, 346 P.3d at 1157.
Accordingly, the ACE policy unambiguous-
ly limits ACE’s liability to $1 million per
accident regardless of the number of cov-
ered autos involved.’ We therefore reverse

ACE’s liability to $ 1 million per accident
regardless of the number of covered autos

1. Searches and Seizures 31.1

When an actor is endowed with law
enforcement powers beyond those enjoyed
by private citizens, courts have traditional-
ly found the exercise of the public police
power engaged, and such actor’s actions
qualify as an agent of the government for
purpose of determining whether a search
by the agent was lawful. U.S. Const.
Amend. 4.

2. Searches and Seizures 31.1
Organization that was statutorily
obliged to operate as official national
clearinghouse for information about miss-
ing and exploited children was a govern-
ment entity for purpose of determining
whether its search of defendant’s e-mail
violated Fourth Amendment right to be
free from unreasonable search and sei-
zure; organization alone was statutorily
obliged to maintain an electronic tipline
for internet service providers (ISP) to use
to report possible internet child sexual ex-
ploitation violations to the government and
to forward every single report it received
to federal law enforcement agencies, ISPs
who failed to report known child pornogra-
phy violations to organization faced sub-
stantial penalties payable to federal gov-
ernment, when organization confirmed it
received a report the ISP was required to
treat that confirmation as a request to
preserve evidence issued by the govern-
ment itself, and organization was statutori-
ly authorized to receive child pornography
knowingly and to review its contents in-
tentionally. U.S. Const.Amend. 4; 18
US.C.A. § 2258A; 42 U.S.C.A. § 5773(b).

3. Searches and Seizures ¢=31.1
Organization that operated as official
national clearinghouse for information
about missing and exploited children was
acting as government entity when it
searched defendant’s e-mail for images of
child pornography; Congress knew and ac-
quiesced in the possibility that organiza-
tion would conduct such searches. U.S.

5. Searches and Seizures 13.1
Telecommunications 1440
Search of defendant’s e-mail by offi-
cial national clearinghouse for information
about missing and exploited children was
an unwarranted search implicating Fourth
Amendment, despite government’s claim
that clearinghouse was merely repeating a
private search performed by internet ser-
vice provider (ISP); unlike clearinghouse,
ISP never opened the e-mail itself, search
of the e-mail disclosed information previ-
ously unknown to the government besides
whether the one attachment contained con-
traband, and could have revealed virtually
any kind of noncontraband information to
the prying eye. U.S. Const.Amend. 4.

PHILLIPS, Circuit Judges.

GORSUCH, Circuit Judge, delivered the
opinion of the Court, in which PHILLIPS,
J., joined. HARTZ, J., joined Parts I, I,
TII(A), and IV.

Walter Ackerman’s email never made it
to its intended recipient. It didn’t because
AOL, Mr. Ackerman’s internet service
provider (ISP), has an automated filter
designed to thwart the transmission of
child pornography. After that filter identi-
fied one of four images attached to Mr.
Ackerman’s email as child pornography,
AOL instantly stopped delivery and the
company soon shuttered Mr. Ackerman’s
account.

How does AOL’s screening system
work? It relies on hash value matching. A
hash value is (usually) a short string of
characters generated from a much larger
string of data (say, an electronic image)
using an algorithm—and calculated in a

831 FEDERAL REPORTER, 3d SERIES

way that makes it highly unlikely another
set of data will produce the same value.
Some consider a hash value as a sort of
digital fingerprint. See Richard P. Salgado,
Fourth Amendment Search and the Power
of the Hash, 119 Harv. L. Rev. F. 38, 38-40
(2005). AOL’s automated filter works by
identifying the hash values of images at-
tached to emails sent through its mail ser-
vers. Those values are then compared to
the hash values of images that AOL em-
ployees have viewed previously and
deemed child pornography. Any email con-
taining an image with a matching hash
value is automatically weeded out.

As soon as AOL identified a hash value
match in this case, the company did just
what federal law requires: it forwarded a
report to the National Center for Missing
and Exploited Children (NCMEC) through
an online tool called the CyberTipline.
AOL’s report included Mr. Ackerman’s
email along with all four attached images.
A NCMEC analyst opened the email,
viewed each of the attached images, and
confirmed that all four (not just the one
AOL’s automated filter identified) ap-
peared to be child pornography. After the
analyst determined as well that Mr. Acker-
man was the likely owner of the account,
NCMEC alerted law enforcement agents
in the area where he lived. And not long
after that, a federal grand jury indicted
Mr. Ackerman on charges of possession
and distribution of child pornography. At
the end of it all, Mr. Ackerman entered a
conditional guilty plea but reserved his
right to appeal the denial of his motion to
suppress the fruits of NCMEC’s investiga-
tion.

We can appreciate why, for his motion
raises (at least) two difficult constitutional
questions. Mr. Ackerman alleges that
NCMEC’s actions amounted to an unrea-
sonable search of his email and its attach-
ments because no one sought a warrant
US. v. ACKERMAN

1295

Cite as 831 F.3d 1292 (10th Cir. 2016)

and no one invoked any recognized lawful
basis for failing to seek one. But the
Fourth Amendment only protects against
unreasonable searches undertaken by the
government or its agents—not private par-
ties. So Mr. Ackerman’s motion raises the
question: does NCMEC qualify as a gov-
ernmental entity or agent? Even if it does,
a second hard question remains. The Su-
preme Court’s “private search” doctrine
suggests the government doesn’t conduct a
Fourth Amendment “search” when it
merely repeats an investigation already
conducted by a private party like AOL.
Which raises this question: did NCMEC
simply repeat or did it exceed the scope of
AOL/’s investigation? For its part, the dis-
trict court denied Mr. Ackerman’s motion
to suppress both because NCMEC is not a
governmental actor and, alternatively and
in any event, because NCMEC’s search
didn’t exceed the scope of AOL’s private
search.

We find we must disagree.

I

Start with the question whether
NCMEC qualifies as a governmental enti-
ty. The problem of drawing a line between
public and private entities is an old and
difficult one. Perhaps the Supreme Court’s
first great tangle with the task came in
Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Wood-
ward, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 518, 668-69, 4
L.Ed. 629 (1819). There the Court suggest-
ed that the calling card of a governmental
entity is whether it is “invested with any
portion of political power, partaking in any
degree in the administration of civil gov-
ernment, and performing duties which flow
from the sovereign authority.” Id. at 634
(opinion of Marshall, C.J.). That an entity
might be incorporated, as NCMEC is,
doesn’t prevent it from also qualifying as a
governmental entity: the dispositive ques-
tion isn’t one of form but function, turning
on what the entity does, not how it is
organized. So, for example, a municipality

may undoubtedly qualify both as a corpo-
ration and as a governmental entity. See
Philips v. Bury (1694) 90 Eng. Rep. 1294,
1299 (“There are in law two sorts of corpo-
rations aggregate of many; such as are for
publick government, and such as are for
private charity.”); 1 Joseph Stancliffe
Davis, Essays in the Earlier History of
American Corporations 72-74 (1917).

[1] When it comes to what qualifies as
a public, political, or sovereign function, we
know too that the “police function” is
among the paradigmatic examples. See Fo-
ley v. Connelie, 435 U.S. 291, 297, 98 S.Ct.
1067, 55 L.Ed.2d 287 (1978) (describing
the “police function” as “one of the basic
functions of government”); Flagg Bros.,
Inc. v. Brooks, 436 U.S. 149, 163, 98 S.Ct.
1729, 56 L.Ed.2d 185 (1978) (noting that
policing is among the “state and municipal
functions” that “have been administered
with a greater degree of exclusivity by
States and municipalities”). Even before
the rise of professional police departments,
a private person dragooned into a “posse
comitatus” bore “the same authority as the
sheriff’ and “was protected [by law] to the
same extent.” Filarsky v. Delia, — US.
——, 132 S.Ct. 1657, 1664, 182 L.Ed.2d
662 (2012); see also 1 William Blackstone,
Commentaries *332. To be sure, some
cases have suggested that the mere inves-
tigation of crime or temporary detention of
suspected criminals by private security
guards is not a uniquely public function.
See, e.g., Gallagher v. “Neil Young Free-
dom Concert,” 49 F.3d 1442, 1457 (10th
Cir. 1995); Wade v. Byles, 83 F.3d 902,
905-06 (7th Cir. 1996); United States v.
Garlock, 19 F.3d 441, 443-44 (8th Cir.
1994). But that’s because the guards’ law-
ful authority to act in those cases was no
broader than that enjoyed by any private
citizen—including the right to carry a
weapon, to use deadly force in self-de-
fense, and to conduct a citizen’s arrest. See
1296

Romanski v. Detroit Entm’t, L.L.C., 428
F.3d 629, 637-38 (6th Cir. 2005). Mean-
while, when an actor is endowed with law
enforcement powers beyond those enjoyed
by private citizens, courts have traditional-
ly found the exercise of the public police
power engaged. Id. at 637.1

[2] NCMEC’s law enforcement powers
extend well beyond those enjoyed by pri-
vate citizens—and in this way it seems to
mark it as a fair candidate for a govern-
mental entity. NCMEC’s two primary au-
thorizing statutes—18 U.S.C. § 2258A and
42 U.S.C. § 5773(b)—mandate its collabo-
ration with federal (as well as state and
local) law enforcement in over a dozen
different ways, many of which involve
duties and powers conferred on and en-
joyed by NCMEC but no other private
person. For example, NCMEC is statutori-
ly obliged to operate the official national
clearinghouse for information about miss-
ing and exploited children, to help law
enforcement locate and recover missing
and exploited children, to “provide forensic
technical assistance to law enforce-
ment” to help identify victims of child ex-
ploitation, to track and identify patterns of
attempted child abductions for law en-
forcement purposes, to “provide training
... to law enforcement agencies in identi-
fying and locating non-compliant sex of-
fenders,” and of course to operate the
CyberTipline as a means of combating In-
ternet child sexual exploitation. 42 U.S.C.
§ 5773(b). Responsibilities and rights Con-
gress has extended to NCMEC alone “un-
der Federal law” and done so specifically
“to assist or support law enforcement
agencies in administration of criminal jus-
tice functions.” Jd. § 16961(a)(1). This spe-

1. Richardson v. McKnight, 521 U.S. 399, 117
S.Ct. 2100, 138 L.Ed.2d 540 (1997), might
appear an exception to this rule, for there the
Supreme Court held that certain private pris-
on guards weren't state actors for purposes of
qualified immunity. Id. at 412, 117 S.Ct.
2100. But Richardson was criticized at the

831 FEDERAL REPORTER, 3d SERIES

cial relationship runs both ways, too, for
NCMEC is also empowered to call on vari-
ous federal agencies for unique forms of
assistance in aid of its statutory functions.
See 18 U.S.C. § 3056(f) (authorizing the
US. Secret Service to provide, “at the
request of” NCMKC, “forensic and investi-
gative assistance in support of any investi-
gation involving missing or exploited chil-
dren”).

Focusing in particular on NCMEC’s Cy-
berTipline functions, the functions at issue
in this case, illustrates and confirms the
special law enforcement duties and powers
it enjoys. First, NCMEC and NCMEC
alone is statutorily obliged to maintain an
electronic tipline for ISPs to use to report
possible Internet child sexual exploitation
violations to the government. Under the
statutory scheme, NCMEC is obliged to
forward every single report it receives to
federal law enforcement agencies and it
may make its reports available to state and
local law enforcement as well. See id.
§ 2258A(c).

Second, ISPs must report any known
child pornography violations to NCMEC.
Not to any other governmental agency, but
again to NCMEC and NCMEC alone.
ISPs who fail to comply with this obli-
gation face substantial (and apparently
criminal) penalties payable to the federal
government. Id. § 2258A(a)(1), (e); see also

ing), and since then the Court has both re-
turned to Dartmouth College’s tried and true
approach and expressly limited Richardson to
its facts, see Filarsky, 132 S.Ct. at 1662-65,

apparent violation, it is subject to criminal
penalties.”).

Third, when NCMEC confirms it has
received a report the ISP must treat that
confirmation as a request to preserve evi-
dence issued by the government itself.
Compare 18 U.S.C. § 2258A(h)(1) (“{T]he
notification to an [ISP] ... by the Cyber-
Tipline of receipt of a report ... shall be
treated as a request to preserve, as if such
request was made pursuant to section
2703(f).”), with id. § 2703(f)(1) (““A[n ISP]

.., upon the request of a governmental
entity, shall take all necessary steps to
preserve records and other evidence in its
possession....”). Failure to comply again
opens an ISP to potential civil or criminal
sanctions. See id. § 2258B.

Fourth, in aid of its tipline functions
NCMEC is statutorily authorized to re-
ceive contraband (child pornography)
knowingly and to review its contents inten-
tionally. Id. § 2258A(a), (b)(4); NCMEC
Amicus Br. at 20-21. Actions that would
normally subject private persons to crimi-
nal prosecution. See 18 USC.
§ 2252A(a)(2) (knowing receipt or distribu-
tion); id. § 2252A(a)(5)(B) (knowing pos-
session or access with intent to view). But
actions that Congress allows NCMEC to
take precisely because of the unique value
it provides in the prosecution of child ex-
ploitation crimes. See R. vol. 3 at 198-99.
Of course, Congress also provides that
ISPs who forward and preserve images of
child pornography in accord with the law
may not be prosecuted. See 18 U.S.C.
§ 2258B(a). But this insulates ISPs only
when they do what any private citizen who
discovers apparent child pornography
might without inviting a real risk of crimi-

2. See, e.g., Missing Children’s Assistance Act,
Pub. L. No. 98-473, 98 Stat. 1837, 2125-27
(1984) (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C.
§ 5771); Pub. L. No. 106-113 app. A, 113
Stat. 1501, 1501A-23 (1999); PROTECT Act,

(codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. § 5773);

nal prosecution: pass evidence along to law
enforcement and comply with its preserva-
tion instructions. All quite unlike NCMEC,
which (again alone) enjoys the right to
receive child pornography knowingly and
review it intentionally.

Recent Supreme Court decisions fortify
our conviction that NCMEC qualifies as a
governmental entity. In a pair of cases the
Court held that Amtrak—a publicly owned
corporation—is a governmental entity. Le-
bron v. Natl R.R. Passenger Corp., 513
USS. 374, 399, 115 S.Ct. 961, 130 L.Ed.2d
902 (1995); Dep't of Transp. v. Ass’n of
Am. R.Rs. (DOT), — U.S. —, 135 S.Ct.
1225, 1233, 191 L.Ed.2d 153 (2015). The
Court began by recalling that the govern-
ment cannot “evade the most solemn obli-
gations imposed in the Constitution by
simply resorting to the corporate form.”
Lebron, 513 U.S. at 397, 115 S.Ct. 961.
Then the Court proceeded to examine the
level of governmental control over Amtrak,
the broad statutory mandates to which it
was subject, its dependence on federal
funding, the purpose behind its creation,
and the benefits it conferred on the gov-
ernment. See id. at 397-400, 115 S.Ct. 961;
see also DOT, 135 S.Ct. at 1231-83. In the
end, the Court held that the “combination”
of these considerations conspired to sug-
gest that Amtrak was indeed a govern-
mental entity. Id. at 1232-33.

Looking to similar considerations here
leads us to a similar conclusion. Much as
Amtrak was created by statute to assume
functions previously carried out by private
railroads, Congress passed statutes to
fund and mandate various of NCMEC’s
functions soon after private parties incor-
porated it.2 Today, NCMEC is statutorily

1298

required to perform over a dozen separate
functions, a fact that evinces the sort of
“day-to-day” statutory control over its op-
erations that the Court found tellingly
present in the Amtrak cases.? Law en-
forcement agents participate at varying
levels in its daily operations,’ and govern-
ment officials enjoy a sizeable presence on
its board.* As much as 75 percent of its
budget (excluding in-kind donations) comes
from the federal government. NCMEC
Amicus Br. at 9. Neither is there any
question about the public benefit NCMEC
confers, for by all accounts its important
work is essential to the identification and
prevention of child sexual exploitation
crimes. Congress and NCMEC alike have
expressly said as much. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C.
§ 5771; National Center for Missing &

3. Compare 42 U.S.C. § 5773(b) (requiring
NCMEC to, among other things, operate a
“national 24-hour toll-free telephone line,”
“cyber tipline,” and ‘“‘child victim identifica-
tion program,” provide “training” and
“technical assistance” to law enforcement
agencies, and develop and disseminate ‘‘in-
formation” to a variety of governmental and
non-governmental entities), with DOT, 135
S.Ct. at 1232 (observing that “Congress has
mandated certain aspects of Amtrak’s day-to-
day operations,” including ‘“maintain[ing] a
route between Louisiana and Florida,” ap-
plying certain considerations when ‘making
improvements to the Northeast corridor,”
and abiding by certain raw material source
requirements when making purchases of
“more than $1 million’).

building, including the FBI, Department of

matter of analogistic reasoning, it’s diffi-

like Amtrak (a mere utility, really) might
qualify as a governmental entity while
NCMEC, an entity afforded so many
unique law enforcement powers, might not.

In the face of so much law and evidence

governmental entity. As a result, the gov-
ernment suggests, any “entity argument”
is waived. Of course, Mr. Ackerman avidly
disputes the government’s assessment and
submits that he pursued both an agent and
an entity theory before the district court.
But who is right about this much doesn’t
much matter. It doesn’t because the Su-
preme Court has specifically held that a
defendant who asserts an agency theory
before the district court preserves an enti-
ty theory on appeal. See Lebron, 513 U.S.
at 378-79, 115 S.Ct. 961. And to this con-
trolling direction the government provides
no answer. So it is that the government’s
only response turns out to be no real re-
sponse at all.

Seeing the void left by the government,
NCMEC offers a number of substantive
responses to Mr. Ackerman’s entity theory
in its own amicus brief. But ours is a
party-directed adversarial system and we
normally limit ourselves to the arguments
the parties before us choose to present.
Amici briefs often serve valuable functions,
but those functions don’t include present-
ing arguments forgone by the parties
themselves or effectively and unilaterally
expanding the word limits established by
rule for a favored party. Indeed, for just
these reasons (and more) this court has
routinely declined to consider arguments
presented only in an amicus brief—and no
one even attempts to offer us a reason to
depart from that practice here. See, e.9.,
Fed. R. App. P. 28; In re McGough, 737
F.3d 1268, 1277 n.8 (10th Cir. 2013); Tyler
v. City of Manhattan, 118 F.3d 1400, 1403-
04 (10th Cir. 1997).

Alternatively and anyway, the various
arguments NCMEC offers do not change
the equation materially. In an effort to
distinguish Lebron from its own case,
NCMEC argues that, unlike Amtrak, it
and its CyberTipline existed for a (brief)
period of time before Congress passed
statutes funding and mandating its func-

tions. But factually the distinction seems
pretty unpersuasive, for many of the as-
sets of what later became Amtrak existed
in private hands long before Amtrak’s stat-
utory authorization. And analytically we
are uncertain why it matters whether
NCMEC was once private. For no one,
NCMEC included, gives us reason to
doubt that even an admittedly private enti-
ty can be made into a public one later by
sufficient statutory action (consider the
Tennessee Valley Authority).

In an effort to establish that even today
it is not a public entity, NCMEC stresses
that it receives some (unspecified amount
of) in-kind donations from private parties
every year and engages in partnerships
with private firms interested in reducing
child exploitation. But it remains undisput-
ed that NCMEC receives the bulk of its
funding from the federal government and
we are aware of no authority suggesting
that the existence of some (unspecified)
amount of in-kind private donations con-
verts a public entity into a private one.
Surely the local public library would dis-
agree—and so might Amtrak for it, too,
receives plenty of private funding (not
merely in-kind donations) from paying cus-
tomers. See 49 U.S.C. § 24301(a)(2) (““Am-
trak ... shall be operated and managed as
a for-profit corporation. ...”). Neither is it
unknown for public entities to partner with
private ones. See Partnerships and Out-
reach, FBI, https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/
partnerships_and_outreach (last visited
July 7, 2016) (“To do its job, the FBI
works with both government and private
sector partners every day... .”).

Next, NCMEC suggests it isn’t required
to spend its federal funding in any particu-
lar way. It may pursue the various law
enforcement functions Congress has iden-
tified, but it doesn’t have to do so. Here
again we cannot agree. The law expressly
states that NCMEC’s federal funding
1300

“shall be used” for over a dozen specifical-
ly enumerated functions. 42 U.S.C.
§ 5773(b). And while “shall” can some-
times mean “may,” that’s the exception
and not the rule, for the word is generally
considered “imperative or mandatory” in
character. Black’s Law Dictionary 1375
(6th ed. 1990). Neither do we see the case
for an exception here. Congress itself has
described NCMEC’s functions as “duties
and responsibilities under Federal law.” 42
US.C. § 16961(a)(1). Neither does anyone
dispute that the use of “shall” in the first
clause of § 5773(b)—providing that “[t]he
Administrator shall annually make a
grant” to NCMEC—is mandatory in char-
acter, and it seems most unlikely that the
same word might bear a different meaning
in the second clause where NCMEC’s
duties are described. After all, we usually
presume Congress means the same thing
when it uses the same word more than
once in the same sentence. See Brown v.
Gardner, 513 U.S. 115, 118, 115 S.Ct. 552,
130 L.Ed.2d 462 (1994). Congress, too, ap-
pears to be well aware of the difference
between “may” and “shall” in the funding
context, for in other similar grant-making
statutes it has indeed adopted the more
permissive “may.” See, eg. 42 U.S.C.
§ 16985(b)(2) (“The Administrator shall
annually make a grant to RAINN, which
shall be used for the performance of the
organization’s national programs, which
may include....” (emphasis added)). And
in other contexts, too, even NCMEC itself
has seemed to characterize its work as
mandatory. See, e.g., Michelle K. Collins,
Child Pornography: A Closer Look, The
Police Chief, Mar. 2007, available at http://
goo.gl/LohIYz (the director of NCMEC’s
Exploited Child Division discussing
“NCMEC’s congressionally mandated Cy-
berTipline”).

Finally, NCMEC suggests that the stat-
utes governing its operations are “like”
routine federal grant-making or state li-
censing statutes. But we just don’t see

831 FEDERAL REPORTER, 3d SERIES

how. Federal grantees and state licensees
don’t typically enjoy (for example) the stat-
utory authority to receive contraband
knowingly, backed by statutes compelling
private and public entities to cooperate
with them. Neither do they typically enjoy
such powers in aid of traditionally public
law enforcement functions. Certainly at no
point in these proceedings has NCMEC or
the government sought to identify a single
federal grantee or state licensee with any-
thing fairly analogous to the sorts of statu-
tory law enforcement powers and duties
NCMEC possesses.

II

Even if we are wrong and NCMEC isn’t
a governmental entity, that doesn’t neces-
sarily mean its searches escape the Fourth
Amendment’s ambit. After all, since time
out of mind the law has prevented agents
from exercising powers their principals do
not possess and so cannot delegate. 1 Wil-
liam Blackstone, Commentaries *417-20;
Restatement (Second) of Agency § 17
(1958). That is a rule of law the founders
knew, understood, and undoubtedly relied
upon when they drafted the Fourth
Amendment—for what would have been
the point of the Amendment if the govern-
ment could have instantly rendered it a
dead letter by the simple expedient of
delegating to agents investigative work it
was forbidden from undertaking itself? In-
deed, it’s long since accepted that the
Amendment’s proscriptions apply not just
to governmental entities but also to those
who serve as the government’s agents in
particular cases. See Skinner v. Ry. Labor
Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 614, 109 S.Ct.
1402, 103 L.Ed.2d 639 (1989) (“Although
the Fourth Amendment does not apply to
a search or seizure, even an arbitrary one,
effected by a private party on his own
initiative, the Amendment protects against
such intrusions if the private party acted
US. v. ACKERMAN

1301

as an instrument or agent of the Govern-
ment.”).

How can we tell if NCMEC acted as the
government’s agent in this case? An agen-
cy relationship is usually said to “result[ ]
from the manifestation of consent by one
person to another that the other shall act
on his behalf and subject to his control,
and consent by the other so to act.” Re-
statement (Second) of Agency § 1. This
manifestation and consent doesn’t have to
be formalized in any particular way. See
id. §§ 15-16. Instead, the “authority to do
an act can be created by written or spoken
words or other conduct of the principal
which, reasonably interpreted, causes the
agent to believe that the principal desires
him so to act on the principal’s account.”
Id. § 26. As well, a principal may delegate
general authority to his or her agent to act
in the ordinary course, without constant
supervision or awareness of every discrete
act. See id. § 7 emt. c. Neither has the
common law traditionally required that the
agent be an altruist, acting without any
intent of advancing some personal interest
along the way (like monetary gain). As
clients know well, lawyers can serve as
their agents all while zealously charging
by the hour. Instead, the question is usual-
ly simply whether the agent acts with the
principal’s consent and (in some way) to
further the principal's purpose. See gener-
ally id. §§ 387-93. All these traditional
agency principles were reasonably well en-
sconced in the law at the time of the
founding and would seem the natural place
to start in understanding the Amendment’s
original meaning and application to gov-
ernmental agents. See generally Joseph
Story, Commentaries on the Law of Agen-
cy (6th ed., Little, Brown & Co. 1863)
(1839); United States v. Ellyson, 326 F.3d
522, 527 (4th Cir. 2003) (noting that the
governmental agent inquiry should be
“guided by common law agency princi-
ples”).

Admittedly, in recent years some courts
have offered more stylized agency tests for
Fourth Amendment cases, which at first
glance may appear to depart from and
demand more than the common law did to
establish an agency relationship. So, for
example, some treat the Fourth Amend-
ment agency inquiry as a three-factor test.
See, e.g., United States v. Silva, 554 F.3d
18, 18 (1st Cir. 2009) (analyzing “[1] the
extent of the government’s role in instigat-
ing or participating in the search, [2] its
intent and the degree of control it exercis-
es over the search and the private party,
and [3] the extent to which the private
party aims primarily to help the govern-
ment or to serve its own interests”). Our
court seems to have adopted a two-part
variation in United States v. Souza, 223
F.3d 1197 (10th Cir. 2000). Jd. at 1201
(asking “1) whether the government knew
of and acquiesced in the intrusive conduct,
and 2) whether the party performing the
search intended to assist law enforcement
efforts or to further his own ends”). Still
others appear to collapse these same fac-
tors into “[o]ne highly pertinent consider-
ation.” Ellyson, 326 F.3d at 527.

[3] But in this particular case it
doesn’t much matter which agency test
you might wish to employ. Even under this
court’s decision in Souza or similar deci-
sions adopted in other circuits it’s hard to
see how we could avoid deeming NCMEC
the government’s agent in this case. Souza
suggests that we should first ask whether
the government “knew of and acquiesced
in” NCMEC’s putative search. Here we
know Congress statutorily required AOL
to forward Mr. Ackerman’s email to
NCMEC; Congress statutorily required
NCMEC to maintain the CyberTipline to
receive emails like Mr. Ackerman’s; Con-
gress statutorily permitted NCMEC to re-
view Mr. Ackerman’s email and attach-
ments; and Congress statutorily required
1302

NCMEC to pass along a report about Mr.
Ackerman’s activities to law enforcement
authorities. All at the government’s ex-
pense and backed by threat of sanction
should AOL have failed to cooperate. All
with special dispensation, too, to NCMEC
to possess and review contraband know-
ingly and intentionally. This comprehen-
sive statutory structure seems more than
enough to suggest both congressional
knowledge of and acquiescence in the pos-
sibility that NCMEC would do exactly as
it did here.

Of course and as the government notes,
Congress’s statutes don’t require NCMEC
to open and view email and attachments
like Mr. Ackerman’s. But everyone accepts
that Congress has authorized and funded
NCMEC to do just that. And everyone
accepts that Congress enabled NCMEC to
review Mr. Ackerman’s email by excepting
the Center from the myriad laws banning
the knowing receipt, possession, and view-
ing of child pornography. Nothing about
NCMEC’s actions could possibly have
come as a surprise. Neither does anything
in Souza (or any other authority cited to
us) suggest that the principal must man-
date rather than merely consent to the
agent’s challenged conduct.

When it comes to Souza’s second factor,
too, we harbor no doubt. Surely, after all,
NCMEC did as it did in this case with
some “inten[tion] to assist” law enforce-
ment. As we’ve seen, Congress authorizes
and funds NCMEC to perform the func-
tions it performed here because (and ex-
pressly premised on the finding that) they
are designed (intended) to help law en-
forcement. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 5771. And
of course NCMEC itself has acknowledged
that it undertakes the sort of conduct chal-
lenged here precisely because (at least in
part) it intends to aid law enforcement.
About Us, NCMEC, http://www.

assistance to law enforcement and families
to find missing children, reduce child sexu-
al exploitation and prevent child victimiza-
tion”).

Bolstering our confidence about all this
is the Supreme Court’s leading Fourth
Amendment agency case, Skinner v. Rail-
way Labor Executives’ Ass’n, 489 US.
602, 109 S.Ct. 1402, 103 L.Ed.2d 639
(1989). There the Federal Railroad Admin-
istration promulgated regulations requir-
ing private railroads to test certain of their
employees for illicit drugs and authorizing
(but not requiring) railroads to test certain
other of their employees. Jd. at 609-12, 109
S.Ct. 1402. The government acknowledged
that the mandatory testing requirements
converted otherwise private railroads into
governmental agents for purposes of the
Fourth Amendment, but it suggested that
the permissive testing requirements did
not. The Supreme Court disagreed. Rather
than endorsing a rigid multi-part agency
test of the sort some lower courts had by
that time devised, the Court seemed to
follow the common law by asking simply
whether “the Government’s encourage-
ment, endorsement, and participation” in
the permissive testing was enough to ren-
der otherwise private railroads agents of
the government for Fourth Amendment
purposes. Id. at 615-16, 109 S.Ct. 1402.
And applying that test here there can be
little doubt of the result it yields. For the
government surely “encouraged and en-
dorsed and participated” in NCMEC’s pu-
tative search for the same reasons it
“knew of and acquiesced in” that activity:
Congress funded the Center, required
AOL to cooperate with it, allowed it to
review Mr. Ackerman’s email by excepting
it from various federal criminal laws, and
statutorily mandated or authorized every
bit of its challenged conduct.

Even if all that is true, and a finding of
agency would be consistent with the com-
US. v. ACKERMAN

1303

Cite as 831 F.3d 1292 (10th Cir. 2016)

mon law at the time of the founding, the
test this court articulated in Souza, and
the test the Supreme Court applied in
Skinner, the government suggests that our
prior decision in United States v. Poe, 556
F.3d 1113 (10th Cir. 2009), still precludes
us from holding that NCMEC acted as its
agent in this case. In Poe, this court faced
the question whether bounty hunters who
searched a home qualified as governmental
agents by virtue of the fact that the state
of Oklahoma regulated the bail bonds in-
dustry. Poe held not. Both because the
mere licensing and regulation of an indus-
try wasn’t enough to suggest that the gov-
ernment knew of or acquiesced in the par-
ticular search in question. And because the
bounty hunters’ purpose or intention in
searching the house was to find a bail-
jumping suspect and so receive a reward
from the bail bondsman that employed
them. Given that, Poe thought it fair to
conclude that the bounty hunters intended
to help themselves or their employer (their
true principal) but “did not intend to assist
law enforcement” at all. Zd. at 1124.

Neither of the grounds on which Poe
rested is present here. As we’ve already
acknowledged, a governmental licensing
and regulation regime does not always suf-
fice to render the licensed or regulated
party a governmental entity or agent. Af-
ter all private lawyers, doctors, and ac-
countants are all licensed and regulated by
the state, yet they don’t (usually) qualify
as governmental entities or agents. But as
we've already observed, too, in this case
we don’t face a general licensing or regula-
tory regime open to all qualified applicants
but a statutory grant of special law en-
forcement authority to a single entity and
no other, authorizing and encouraging it to
perform functions no other private person
or entity may lawfully undertake. And as
we've seen, helping law enforcement is at
least part of NCMEC’s intentions when it
reviews emails pursuant to its statutory
tipline authority.

Admittedly, the government reads Poe
differently than we do. It reads the deci-
sion as suggesting that a private party who
bears any private purpose cannot serve as
a governmental agent. But this reading is
a misreading. After all, and as we’ve seen,
the common law recognized that agents
routinely intend to serve their principals
with the further intention to make money
for themselves. In Skinner, too, the fact
that the private railroads had private (eco-
nomic) reasons for seeking to curb drug
abuse by railroad employees—and had
sought to do so before the government
promulgated its regulations, 489 U.S. at
606-07, 109 S.Ct. 1402—was no barrier to
the Court’s determination that the statuto-
ry scheme converted the railroads into
governmental agents. And in United
States v. Leffall, 82 F.3d 343 (10th Cir.
1996), this court likewise expressly ex-
plained that the agency question cannot be
resolved “simply” by “evaluat[ing] the pri-
vate person’s state of mind—whether his
motive to aid law enforcement preponder-
ates.” Id. at 347. Neither do we read Poe
as disagreeing with any of this standard
stuff but as suggesting instead and much
more modestly that a question about a
claim of agency may arise when a private
party bears no intention to assist the gov-
ernment. Or put another way, when the
agent serves a different principal and not
the government. Nothing like that compli-
cation is present here.

One final wrinkle remains to unfold on
the agency question. The government in-
sists that whether NCMEC is a govern-
mental agent is a question of fact, permit-
ting this court to reverse the district
court’s determination only if it clearly
erred. For our part, we readily agree that
this court is obligated to give great defer-
ence to the district court’s findings of his-
toric fact—something we have done in our
analysis above and find little difficulty do-
ing, for the historic facts are (materially)
1304

undisputed in this case. But having said
that much, we cannot agree with the gov-
ernment if it means to suggest that the
deference we owe to the district court’s
factual findings extends to its definition of
the “legal concept” of agency, Restatement
(Second) of Agency § 1 cmt. b, or to the
question whether the facts the district
court found are sufficient to satisfy it. It is
for this court to decide (de novo) what the
law is and whether the facts (as found by
the district court and so long as they are
not clearly erroneous) satisfy its demands.
See Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690,
694-99, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911
(1996) (holding that appellate courts must
review a district court’s determination of
reasonable suspicion and probable cause
de novo, with deference to its findings of
historic fact); United States v. Ginglen,
467 F.3d 1071, 1074 (7th Cir. 2006) (ac-
knowledging Ornelas’s relevance to review
of a governmental agency determination).
Nothing in the case the government pur-
ports to rely upon abandons these stolid
principles of appellate review found most
everywhere in the law. To the contrary, it
explains quite rightly that “[w]e review the
district court’s findings of fact” relevant to
an agency determination “under a clearly
erroneous standard,” but “review de novo
the ultimate question of constitutional
law,” Leffall, 82 F.3d at 347—and the
Fourth Amendment agency question is un-
questionably one of constitutional law.

Tl

[4] Assuming NCMEC is a govern-
mental entity or agent, its actions still
implicate the Fourth Amendment only if a
“search” took place here. On first blush,

6. The record shows that what NCMEC re-
ceived from AOL was an email—technically,
a .eml file—which contained the four attach-
ments. See R. vol. 3 at 15-16 (law enforcement
describing the “.eml file’ as the “actual file
that AOL sends through [NCMEC’s] Tipline,”
which, when opened, ‘‘show[s] ... the e-

831 FEDERAL REPORTER, 3d SERIES

the answer to that question might seem
obvious. No one in this appeal disputes
that an email is a “paper” or “effect” for
Fourth Amendment purposes, a form of
communication capable of storing all sorts
of private and personal details, from corre-
spondence to images, video or audio files,
and so much more. See United States v.
Cotterman, 709 F.3d 952, 964 (9th Cir.
2013) (en banc); cf United States v. Li-
chtenberger, 786 F.3d 478, 489 (6th Cir.
2015). The undisputed facts show, too, that
NCMEC opened Mr. Ackerman’s email,
found four attachments, and proceeded to
view each of them.’ And that sort of rum-
maging through private papers or effects
would seem pretty obviously a “search.”
After all, if opening and reviewing “physi-
cal” mail is generally a “search”—and it is,
Ex Parte Jackson, 96 U.S. 727, 733, 24
L.Ed. 877 (1877); United States v. Van
Leeuwen, 397 U.S. 249, 251, 90 S.Ct. 1029,
25 L.Ed.2d 282 (1970)—why not “virtual”
mail too?

Admittedly, it’s an open question wheth-
er the Supreme Court’s so-called “third-
party doctrine” might undermine any
claim to Fourth Amendment protections
when someone (like Mr. Ackerman) en-
gages a private agent (like AOL) to deliver
his correspondence. The Court has, after
all, suggested that individuals lack any
reasonable expectation of privacy and so
forfeit any Fourth Amendment protections
in materials they choose to share with
third parties like banks or telephone com-
panies. See, e.g., United States v. Miller,
425 U.S. 435, 440-43, 96 S.Ct. 1619, 48
L.Ed.2d 71 (1976); Smith v. Maryland, 442

this case there is one uploaded file,” a ‘“‘.eml

late, [or] change,” with “four images located

US. v. ACKERMAN

1305

Cite as 831 F.3d 1292 (10th Cir. 2016)

220 (1979). And lower courts have only
begun to consider whether (and to what
extent) the doctrine should be extended to
email where (as here) a subscriber relies
on a commercial ISP to store and deliver
it. Compare United States v. Forrester,
512 F.3d 500, 510-11 (9th Cir. 2007) (find-
ing no Fourth Amendment protection for
the “to/from addresses of e-mail mes-
sages”), with United States v. Warshak,
631 F.3d 266, 283-88 (6th Cir. 2010) (find-
ing Fourth Amendment protection for
email contents). But the district court
didn’t rely upon third-party doctrine in
ruling against Mr. Ackerman. Exactly to
the contrary, throughout its decision the
court assumed that Mr. Ackerman had a
reasonable expectation of privacy in his
email. And though we may of course affirm
the district court’s judgment on any basis
the record supports, we think making the
attempt here imprudent given that the dis-
trict court has yet to make any factual
findings relevant to Mr. Ackerman’s sub-
jective expectations of privacy or the ob-
jective reasonableness of those expecta-
tions in light of the parties’ dealings (e.g.,
the extent to which AOL regularly ac-
cessed emails and the extent to which
users were aware of or acquiesced in such
access). Facts that could well impact the
legal analysis. See, e.g., Harper v. P. Urba-
no, P.A., 342 Fed.Appx. 380, 382 (10th Cir.
2009).

A

Even so, the government says there’s
another Fourth Amendment doctrine that
compels a ruling in its favor, one the dis-
trict court did cite and rely upon, this one
called the “private search” doctrine and
often associated with United States v. Ja-
cobsen, 466 U.S. 109, 104 S.Ct. 1652, 80
L.Ed.2d 85 (1984). In that case, FedEx
employees opened a damaged package,
found suspicious plastic bags of white pow-
der inside, and passed the parcel to the
government, along with a description of

what they’d found. 7d. at 111, 104 S.Ct.
1652. A DEA agent then repeated the
same investigation, opening the package
and examining its contents. Jd. Finally, he
subjected the white powder to a chemical
drug test to confirm it was cocaine. Id. at
111-12, 104 S.Ct. 1652. Considering all
this, the Supreme Court held that no
“search” implicating the Fourth Amend-
ment had taken place because there was a
“virtual certainty” that (but for one thing)
the government could have discovered
“nothing else of significance” in the pack-
age nor learned anything beyond what it
had “already ... been told” by a private
party. Zd. at 119, 104 S.Ct. 1652.

The one thing, of course, was the drug
test. FedEx didn’t test the chemical com-
position of the white powder and the gov-
ernment did. And so you might well ask,
why isn’t at least that a search implicating
the Fourth Amendment? The Court ac-
knowledged that the drug test promised to
(and surely did) reveal information previ-
ously unknown to FedEx. Yet the Court
proceeded to hold that the drug test still
didn’t qualify as a Fourth Amendment
search because it “merely disclose[d]”
whether the powder was contraband “and
no other arguably ‘private’ fact.” Id. at
123, 104 S.Ct. 1652. In these circum-
stances, the Court announced, the govern-
ment’s apparent search was no search at
all because it compromised no “legitimate
privacy interest” within the meaning of
Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 88
S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967). Jacobsen,
466 U.S. at 123, 104 S.Ct. 1652.

[5] Accepting our obligation as a lower
court to apply both aspects of Jacobsen’s
private search doctrine faithfully, we fail
all the same to see how they might help
the government in this case. Yes, AOL ran
a search that suggested a hash value
match between one attachment to Mr.
Ackerman’s email and an image AOL em-
1306

ployees had previously identified as child
pornography. But AOL never opened the
email itself. Only NCMEC did that, and in
at least this way exceeded rather than
repeated AOL’s private search. Neither is
there any doubt NCMEC’s search of the
email itself quite easily “could [have] dis-
close[d]” information previously unknown
to the government besides whether the
one attachment contained contraband. Id.
at 122, 104 S.Ct. 1652. Indeed, when
NCMEC opened Mr. Ackerman’s email it
could have learned any number of private
and protected facts, for (again) no one
before us disputes that an email is a virtu-
al container, capable of storing all sorts of
private and personal details, from corre-
spondence to other private (and perfectly
legal) images, video or audio files, and
beyond. See, eg., Warshak, 631 F.3d at
284. And we know, too, that this particular
container did contain three additional at-
tachments, the content of which AOL and
NCMEC knew nothing about before
NCMEC opened them too. As far as any-
one knew at the time, they could have
revealed virtually any kind of noncontra-
band information to the prying eye.

Our view about the inapplicability of Ja-
cobsen’s private search doctrine finds sup-
port in at least two related cases. In Unit-
ed States v. Place, 462 U.S. 696, 103 S.Ct.
2637, 77 L.Ed.2d 110 (1983), the Court
held that a dog sniff of luggage by a “well-
trained narcotics detection dog” didn’t of-
fend the Fourth Amendment because it
didn’t “require opening the luggage” and
could have suggested only the presence or
absence of “contraband items.” Jd. at 707,
103 S.Ct. 2637 (quoted in Jacobsen, 466
USS. at 124, 104 S.Ct. 1652). Meanwhile, in
Walter v. United States, 447 U.S. 649, 100
S.Ct. 2395, 65 L.Ed.2d 410 (1980), the
Court held law enforcement’s projection
and viewing of films did implicate the Con-
stitution because the prior private search
was much narrower, involving only the
visual inspection of the labels on the out-

831 FEDERAL REPORTER, 3d SERIES

side of the film boxes. See id. at 656-60,
100 S.Ct. 2395 (opinion of Stevens, J.). As
interpreted by the Court in Jacobsen, the
analytical thread stitching together these
results and its own is the question whether
“the governmental conduct could [have]
reveal[ed] nothing about noncontraband
items.” 466 U.S. at 124 n.24, 104 S.Ct.
1652. In Place and Jacobsen, the govern-
ment’s conduct could have revealed noth-
ing about noncontraband items, so no
“search” took place within the meaning of
the Fourth Amendment. In Walter, by
contrast, the government’s conduct could
have revealed something previously un-
known about noncontraband items, so a
constitutionally triggering “search” did
take place. And by the same reasoning the
same result should follow here.

At this point you might wonder about a
similar but different scenario than the one
we confront today. What if NCMEC
hadn't opened Mr. Ackerman’s email but
had somehow directly accessed (only) the
(one) attached image with the matching
hash value? Could the government have
argued that, in that case, NCMEC’s ac-
tions didn’t risk exposing any private in-
formation beyond what AOL had already
reported to it? Or might even that have
risked exposing new and protected infor-
mation, maybe because the hash value
match could have proven mistaken (unlike-
ly if not impossible) or because the AOL
employee who identified the original image
as child pornography was mistaken in his
assessment (unlikely if maybe more possi-
ble)? See Salgado, supra, at 45-46. Inter-
esting questions, to be sure, but ones we
don’t have to resolve in this case. We don’t
because the undisputed facts before us
indicate that NCMEC opened Mr. Acker-
man’s email first and did so before and in
order to view not just the attachment that
was the target of AOL’s private search but
three others as well. And as we’ve seen,
each of these steps—opening the email and
US. v. ACKERMAN

1307

Cite as 831 F.3d 1292 (10th Cir. 2016)

viewing the three other attachments—was
enough to risk exposing private, noncon-
traband information that AOL had not
previously examined.

B

Our conclusion about this is confirmed
by yet another and distinct line of authori-
ty. Jacobsen said no “search” implicating
the Fourth Amendment took place even
when officers exceeded the scope of the
search previously performed by the pri-
vate party and removed and destroyed a
small amount of powder to conduct a drug
test. In doing so, Jacobsen invoked Katz
and held there was no “reasonable expec-
tation of privacy” in concealing whether
something is or isn’t contraband. See 466
US. at 122-23, 104 S.Ct. 1652. But after
United States v. Jones, — U.S. ——, 132
S.Ct. 945, 181 L.Ed.2d 911 (2012), there’s
reason to wonder about that conclusion.
After all, Jones held that the Katz formula
is but one way to determine if a constitu-
tionally qualifying “search” has taken
place. Id. at 949-51. In light of the Fourth
Amendment’s original meaning, Jones ex-
plained that government conduct can con-
stitute a Fourth Amendment search either
when it infringes on a reasonable expecta-
tion of privacy or when it involves a physi-
cal intrusion (a trespass) on a constitution-
ally protected space or thing (“persons,
houses, papers, and effects”) for the pur-
pose of obtaining information. So the fact
the government’s conduct doesn’t trigger
Katz doesn’t mean it doesn’t trigger the
Fourth Amendment. Id. at 950 (“Fourth
Amendment rights do not rise or fall with
the Katz formulation.... [F]or most of
our history the Fourth Amendment was
understood to embody a particular concern
for government trespass upon the areas

. it enumerates. Katz did not repudiate
that understanding.”).

Reexamining the facts of Jacobsen in

light of Jones, it seems at least possible
the Court today would find that a “search”

did take place there. After all, the DEA
agent who performed the drug test in Ja-
cobsen took and destroyed a “trace
amount” of private property, 466 U.S. at
125, 104 S.Ct. 1652, a seeming trespass to
chattels. Neither is there any question that
the purpose and effect of the agent’s action
was to obtain information. See id. at 122-
23, 104 S.Ct. 1652. And while the destruc-
tion of only a “trace amount” of private
property might not amount to a trespass
under modern tort law, even less was re-
quired to establish a claim of trespass to
chattels at the time of the founding—and
we know the Fourth Amendment is no less
protective of persons and property against
governmental invasions than the common
law was at the time of the founding. Jones,
132 S.Ct. at 950, 953; id. at 957 n.2 (Alito,
J., concurring in the judgment) (“At com-
mon law, a suit for trespass to chattels
could be maintained if there was a viola-
tion of ‘the dignitary interest in the inviola-
bility of chattels,’ but today there must be
‘some actual damage to the chattel before
the action can be maintained.’” (quoting
W. Keeton et al., Prosser & Keeton on
Law of Torts § 14, at 87 (5th ed. 1984))).

Given the uncertain status of Jacobsen
after Jones, we cannot see how we might
ignore Jones’s potential impact on our
case. And its impact here seems even
clearer than in Jacobsen. After all, we are
not dealing with a governmental drug test
that destroyed but a trace amount of po-
tential contraband. We are dealing instead
with the warrantless opening and examina-
tion of (presumptively) private correspon-
dence that could have contained much be-
sides potential contraband for all anyone
knew. And that seems pretty clearly to
qualify as exactly the type of trespass to
chattels that the framers sought to prevent
when they adopted the Fourth Amend-
ment. See, e.g., 1 Thomas M. Cooley, The
General Principles of Constitutional Law
in the United States of America 212 & n.2
1308

(1880); Thomas M. Cooley, A Treatise on
the Constitutional Limitations Which Rest
upon the Legislative Power of the States
of the American Union 306 n.2 (1868); Ha
parte Jackson, 96 U.S. at 733. Of course,
the framers were concerned with the pro-
tection of physical rather than virtual cor-
respondence. But a more obvious analogy
from principle to new technology is hard to
imagine and, indeed, many courts have
already applied the common law’s ancient
trespass to chattels doctrine to electronic,
not just written, communications. See, e.g.,
eBay, Inc. v. Bidder’s Edge, Inc., 100
F.Supp.2d 1058, 1063, 1069-70 (N.D. Cal.
2000); CompuServe Inc. v. Cyber Pro-
motions, Inc., 962 F.Supp. 1015, 1019, 1027
(S.D. Ohio 1997); Thrifty-Tel, Inc. v. Bez-
enek, 46 Cal.App.4th 1559, 1565-67, 54 Cal.
Rptr.2d 468 (1996). So it seems that,
whether we analyze the “search” question
through the lens of the government’s pre-
ferred authority—Jacobsen and Katz—or
through the lens of the traditional trespass
test suggested by Jones, they yield the
same (and pretty intuitive) result:
NCMEC conducted a “search” when it
opened and examined Mr. Ackerman’s
email.

IV

[6] Having determined that NCMEC
is a governmental entity or agent and that
it searched Mr. Ackerman’s email without
a warrant, at this point you might wonder
whether the government could argue that
NCMEC’s search still qualifies as a “rea-
sonable” one because of, say, exigent cir-
cumstances or the “special needs” doc-
trine. Or whether any Fourth Amendment
violation in opening the email or the three
other attachments was too attenuated from
the discovery of incriminating evidence in
the matching hash value attachment to
justify exclusion as the appropriate reme-
dy. Or whether suppression might also be
an inappropriate remedy because NCMEC
acted in “good faith.” But the government

831 FEDERAL REPORTER, 3d SERIES

argues none of these points in this appeal,
seeming instead to accept that if NCMEC
was a governmental entity or agent and if
its opening of the email was an unwarrant-
ed search, then its subsequent discovery of
four attached images of child pornography
was “fruit of a poisonous tree” and should
be suppressed. Indeed, the closest the gov-
ernment comes to briefing any of these
questions is to tell us it incorporates by
reference the good faith arguments it pre-
sented to the district court. Even though
this court has repeatedly instructed (both
in rule and case law) that this sort of
mechanical “[iJncorporating by reference
portions of lower court or agency briefs or
pleadings” is insufficient to preserve a
point for appellate review. 10th Cir. R.
28.4; see also Gaines-Tabb v. ICI Explo-
sives, USA, Inc., 160 F.3d 613, 623-24
(10th Cir. 1998).

So with that, our encounter with this
case comes to an end—at least for now.
Surely hard questions remain to be re-
solved on remand, not least the question
whether the third-party doctrine might
preclude Mr. Ackerman’s claim to the
Fourth Amendment’s application, a ques-
tion the government has preserved and the
district court and we have reserved. But
about one thing we can be very certain.
There can be no doubt that NCMEC does
important work and that its work can con-
tinue without interruption. After all, it
could be that the third-party doctrine will
preclude motions to suppress like Mr. Ack-
erman’s. Or that changes in how reports
are submitted or reviewed might allow
NCMEC to access attachments with
matching hash values directly, without re-
viewing email correspondence or other at-
tachments with possibly private, noncon-
traband content—and in this way perhaps
bring the government closer to a success-
ful invocation of the private search doc-
trine. Or it may be possible that the gov-
ernment could cite exigent circumstances
ZIEGLER v. MARTIN COUNTY SCHOOL DIST.

1309

Cite as 831 F.3d 1309 (11th Cir. 2016)

or attenuation doctrine or special needs
doctrine or the good faith exception to
excuse warrantless searches or avoid sup-
pression in at least some cases. But even if
not a single one of these potential scenar-
ios plays out—and we do not mean to
prejudge any of them—we are confident
that NCMEC’s law enforcement partners
will struggle not at all to obtain warrants
to open emails when the facts in hand
suggest, as they surely did here, that a
crime against a child has taken place.

The district court’s denial of the motion
to suppress is reversed. The case is re-
manded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.

United States Court of Appeals,
Eleventh Circuit.

July 28, 2016
Background: Students brought § 1983
action against school district, high school
and its officials, and county sheriff and his
resource officer, alleging Fourth Amend-
ment violations related to search of party
bus and detention for administration of
breath tests for blood alcohol concentra-
tion prior to entering prom. The United

States District Court for the Southern Dis-

trict of Florida, No. 2:14-cv-14221-DMM,

granted defendants’ summary judgment
motion. Students appealed.

Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Fay,

Circuit Judge, held that:

(1) resource officer’s searching bus for al-
cohol prior to admitting students into
prom did not elevate Fourth Amend-
ment standard from public-school con-
text to one of probable cause;

(2) students did not have any actual or
reasonable expectation of privacy in
party bus;

(3) bus driver had apparent authority to
give consent for resource officer to
search bus;

(4) resource officer had reasonable basis
for believing students had violated
school’s rules and state law, and de-
taining students prior to performing
breath tests was reasonably related in
scope;

(5) resource officer unreasonably detained
all students from party bus while each
of them was administered breath test;

(6) individual school officials and resource
officer were entitled to qualified immu-
nity;

(7) school officials did not violate First
Amendment rights by disciplining two
students for cursing while breath tests
