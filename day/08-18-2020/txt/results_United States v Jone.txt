lack of preclearance under § 5 of the Vot-
ing Rights Act of 1965. Ante, at 939-940.
In my view, Texas’ failure to timely obtain
§ 5 preclearance of its new plans is no
obstacle to their implementation, because,
as I have previously explained, § 5 is un-
constitutional. See Northwest Austin Mu-
nicipal Util. Dist. No. One v. Holder, 557
US. 193, 212, 129 S.Ct. 2504, 174 L.Ed.2d
140 (2009) (THOMAS, J., concurring in
judgment in part and dissenting in part).
Although Texas’ new plans are being chal-
lenged on the grounds that they violate the
Federal Constitution and § 2 of the Voting
Rights Act, they have not yet been found
to violate any law. Accordingly, Texas’
duly enacted redistricting plans should
govern the upcoming elections. I would
therefore vacate the interim orders and
remand for the United States District
Court for the Western District of Texas to
consider appellees’ constitutional and § 2
challenges in the ordinary course.

UNITED STATES, Petitioner
v.

Antoine JONES.
No. 10-1259.
Argued Nov. 8, 2011.

Decided Jan. 23, 2012.
Background: Following denial of motion
to suppress evidence, 451 F.Supp.2d 71,
and denial of motion for reconsideration,
511 F.Supp.2d 74, defendants were con-
victed in the United States District Court
for the District of Columbia, Huvelle, J., of
conspiracy to distribute and to possess
with intent to distribute five kilograms or
more of cocaine and 50 grams or more of

cocaine base. They appealed. The United
States Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia, Ginsburg, Circuit Judge, 615
F.3d 544, reversed. Certiorari was grant-
ed.

Holding: The Supreme Court, Justice
Scalia, held that attachment of Global—
Positioning-System (GPS) tracking device
to vehicle, and subsequent use of that de-
vice to monitor vehicle’s movements on
public streets, was search within meaning
of Fourth Amendment.

Affirmed.

Justice Sotomayor filed concurring opin-
ion.

Justice Alito filed opinion concurring in the
judgment, in which Justices Ginsburg,
Breyer, and Kagan joined.

1. Searches and Seizures <=60.1

Vehicle is an “effect” as that term is
used in Fourth Amendment, which pro-
vides that “[t]he right of the people to be
secure in their persons, houses, papers,
and effects, against unreasonable searches
and seizures, shall not be violated.”

2. Searches and Seizures 21

Government’s installation of Global-
Positioning-System (GPS) tracking device
on target’s vehicle, and its use of that
device to monitor vehicle’s movements,
constitutes a “search,” within meaning of
Fourth Amendment. U.S.C.A. Const.
Amend. 4.

See publication Words and Phras-

In determining what constitutes
search, Supreme Court must assure pres-

government that existed when Fourth
Amendment was adopted. U.S.C.A.
Const.Amend. 4.

tionally protected area, “search” within
original meaning of Fourth Amendment
has occurred. U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 4.

5. Searches and Seizures ¢=13.1

Under Fourth Amendment, “seizure”
of property occurs, not when there is a
trespass, but when there is some meaning-
ful interference with an individual’s posses-
sory interests in that property. U.S.C.A.
Const.Amend. 4.

ernment did not raise argument below, so

U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 4.

Syllabus *

The Government obtained a search
warrant permitting it to install a Global-
Positioning-System (GPS) tracking device
on a vehicle registered to respondent
Jones’s wife. The warrant authorized in-
stallation in the District of Columbia and
within 10 days, but agents installed the
device on the 11th day and in Maryland.
The Government then tracked the vehicle’s
movements for 28 days. It subsequently
secured an indictment of Jones and others
on drug trafficking conspiracy charges.
The District Court suppressed the GPS
data obtained while the vehicle was parked
at Jones’s residence, but held the remain-
ing data admissible because Jones had no
reasonable expectation of privacy when the
vehicle was on public streets. Jones was
convicted. The D.C. Circuit reversed, con-
cluding that admission of the evidence ob-
tained by warrantless use of the GPS de-
vice violated the Fourth Amendment.

Held: The Government’s attachment
of the GPS device to the vehicle, and its
use of that device to monitor the vehicle’s
movements, constitutes a search under the
Fourth Amendment. Pp. 948 - 954.

(a) The Fourth Amendment protects
the “right of the people to be secure in
their persons, houses, papers, and effects,
against unreasonable searches and sei-
zures.” Here, the Government’s physical
intrusion on an “effect” for the purpose of

obtaining information constitutes a
“search.” This type of encroachment on
the reader. See United States v. Detroit Tim-

ber & Lumber Co., 200 U.S. 321, 337, 26 S.Ct.
282, 50 L.Ed. 499.
US. v. JONES

947

Cite as 132 S.Ct. 945 (2012)

an area enumerated in the Amendment
would have been considered a search with-
in the meaning of the Amendment at the
time it was adopted. Pp. 948 - 949.

(b) This conclusion is consistent with
this Court’s Fourth Amendment jurispru-
dence, which until the latter half of the
20th century was tied to common-law tres-
pass. Later cases, which have deviated
from that exclusively property-based ap-
proach, have applied the analysis of Justice
Harlan’s concurrence in Katz v. United
States, 389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19
L.Ed.2d 576, which said that the Fourth
Amendment protects a person’s “reason-
able expectation of privacy,” id., at 360, 88
S.Ct. 507. Here, the Court need not ad-
dress the Government’s contention that
Jones had no “reasonable expectation of
privacy,” because Jones’s Fourth Amend-
ment rights do not rise or fall with the
Katz formulation. At bottom, the Court
must “assur[e] preservation of that degree
of privacy against government that existed
when the Fourth Amendment was
adopted.” Kyllo v. United States, 533 U.S.
27, 34, 121 S.Ct. 2038, 150 L.Ed.2d 94.
Katz did not repudiate the understanding
that the Fourth Amendment embodies a
particular concern for government tres-
pass upon the areas it enumerates. The
Katz reasonable-expectation-of-privacy
test has been added to, but not substituted
for, the common-law trespassory test. See
Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165,
176, 89 S.Ct. 961, 22 L.Ed.2d 176; Soldal
v. Cook County, 506 U.S. 56, 64, 113 S.Ct.
588, 121 L.Ed.2d 450. United States v.
Knotts, 460 U.S. 276, 103 S.Ct. 1081, 75
L.Ed.2d 55, and United States v. Karo, 468
US. 705, 104 S.Ct. 3296, 82 L.Ed.2d 530—
post-Katz cases rejecting Fourth Amend-
ment challenges to “beepers,” electronic
tracking devices representing another
form of electronic monitoring—do not fore-
close the conclusion that a search occurred
here. New York v. Class, 475 U.S. 106,

106 S.Ct. 960, 89 L.Ed.2d 81, and Oliver v.
United States, 466 U.S. 170, 104 S.Ct.
1735, 80 L.Ed.2d 214, also do not support
the Government’s position. Pp. 949-954.

(c) The Government’s alternative ar-
gument—that if the attachment and use of
the device was a search, it was a reason-
able one—is forfeited because it was not
raised below. P. 954.

Justice SCALIA delivered the opinion of
the Court.

We decide whether the attachment of a
Global-Positioning-System (GPS) tracking
device to an individual’s vehicle, and subse-
quent use of that device to monitor the
vehicle’s movements on public streets, con-
stitutes a search or seizure within the
meaning of the Fourth Amendment.

I

In 2004 respondent Antoine Jones, own-
er and operator of a nightclub in the Dis-
trict of Columbia, came under suspicion of
trafficking in narcotics and was made the
target of an investigation by a joint FBI
and Metropolitan Police Department task
force. Officers employed various investi-
gative techniques, including visual surveil-
lance of the nightclub, installation of a
camera focused on the front door of the
club, and a pen register and wiretap cover-
ing Jones’s cellular phone.

Based in part on information gathered
from these sources, in 2005 the Govern-
ment applied to the United States District
Court for the District of Columbia for a
warrant authorizing the use of an electron-
ic tracking device on the Jeep Grand Cher-
okee registered to Jones’s wife. A war-
rant issued, authorizing installation of the
device in the District of Columbia and
within 10 days.

On the 11th day, and not in the District
of Columbia but in Maryland,’ agents in-
stalled a GPS tracking device on the un-
dercarriage of the Jeep while it was
parked in a public parking lot. Over the
next 28 days, the Government used the

device to track the vehicle’s movements,
and once had to replace the device’s bat-
tery when the vehicle was parked in a
different public lot in Maryland. By
means of signals from multiple satellites,
the device established the vehicle’s location
within 50 to 100 feet, and communicated
that location by cellular phone to a Gov-
ernment computer. It relayed more than
2,000 pages of data over the 4—week peri-
od.

The Government ultimately obtained a

co-conspirators with,

cocaine and 50 grams

or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21
U.S.C. §§ 841 and 846. Before trial,
Jones filed a motion to suppress evidence
obtained through the GPS device. The
District Court granted the motion only in
part, suppressing the data obtained while
the vehicle was parked in the garage ad-
joining Jones’s residence. 451 F.Supp.2d
71, 88 (2006). It held the remaining data
admissible, because “‘[a] person traveling
in an automobile on public thoroughfares
has no reasonable expectation of privacy in
his movements from one place to anoth-
er.”” Ibid. (quoting United States v.
Knotts, 460 U.S. 276, 281, 103 S.Ct. 1081,
75 L.Ed.2d 55 (1983)). Jones’s trial in
October 2006 produced a hung jury on the
conspiracy count.

 

In March 2007, a grand jury returned
another indictment, charging Jones and
others with the same conspiracy. The
Government introduced at trial the same
GPS-derived locational data admitted in
the first trial, which connected Jones to
the alleged conspirators’ stash house that
contained $850,000 in cash, 97 kilograms of

The jury returned a guilty verdict, and the
District Court sentenced Jones to life im-
prisonment.

The United States Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit reversed
the conviction because of admission of the
evidence obtained by warrantless use of
the GPS device which, it said, violated the
Fourth Amendment. United States v.
Maynard, 615 F.3d 544 (2010). The D.C.
Circuit denied the Government’s petition
for rehearing en banc, with four judges
dissenting. 625 F.3d 766 (2010). We

A

[1,2] The Fourth Amendment pro-
vides in relevant part that “[t]he right of
the people to be secure in their persons,
houses, papers, and effects, against unrea-
sonable searches and seizures, shall not be
violated.” It is beyond dispute that a vehi-
cle is an “effect” as that term is used in
the Amendment. United States v. Chad-
wick, 433 U.S. 1, 12, 97 S.Ct. 2476, 53
L.Ed.2d 538 (1977). We hold that the
Government’s installation of a GPS device
on a target’s vehicle,” and its use of that
device to monitor the vehicle’s movements,
constitutes a “search.”

It is important to be clear about what
occurred in this case: The Government
physically occupied private property for
the purpose of obtaining information. We
have no doubt that such a physical intru-
sion would have been considered a

2. As we have noted, the Jeep was registered to
Jones’s wife. The Government acknowl-
edged, however, that Jones was ‘“‘the exclusive
driver.” Id., at 555, n. * (internal quotation
marks omitted). If Jones was not the owner
he had at least the property rights of a bailee.
The Court of Appeals concluded that the vehi-

“search” within the meaning of the Fourth
Amendment when it was adopted. E'ntick
v. Carrington, 95 Eng. Rep. 807 (C.P.
1765), is a “case we have described as a
‘monument of English freedom’ ‘undoubt-
edly familiar’ to ‘every American states-
man’ at the time the Constitution was
adopted, and considered to be ‘the true
and ultimate expression of constitutional
law’” with regard to search and seizure.
Brower v. County of Inyo, 489 U.S. 593,
596, 109 S.Ct. 1378, 103 L.Ed.2d 628 (1989)
(quoting Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S.
616, 626, 6 S.Ct. 524, 29 L.Ed. 746 (1886)).
In that case, Lord Camden expressed in
plain terms the significance of property
rights in search-and-seizure analysis:

“{O]ur law holds the property of every
man so sacred, that no man can set his
foot upon his neighbour’s close without
his leave; if he does he is a trespasser,
though he does no damage at all; if he
will tread upon his neighbour’s ground,
he must justify it by law.” Entick, su-
pra, at 817.

The text of the Fourth Amendment re-
flects its close connection to property,
since otherwise it would have referred sim-
ply to “the right of the people to be secure
against unreasonable searches and _ sei-
zures”; the phrase “in their persons, hous-
es, papers, and effects” would have been
superfluous.

Consistent with this understanding, our
Fourth Amendment jurisprudence was
tied to common-law trespass, at least until
the latter half of the 20th century. Kyllo
v. United States, 533 U.S. 27, 31, 121 S.Ct.
2038, 150 L.Ed.2d 94 (2001); Kerr, The

cle’s registration did not affect his ability to
make a Fourth Amendment objection, ibid.,
and the Government has not challenged that
determination here. We therefore do not
consider the Fourth Amendment significance
of Jones’s status.

Fourth Amendment and New Technolo-
gies: Constitutional Myths and the Case
for Caution, 102 Mich. L.Rev. 801, 816
(2004). Thus, in Olmstead v. United
States, 277 U.S. 438, 48 S.Ct. 564, 72 L.Ed.
944 (1928), we held that wiretaps attached
to telephone wires on the public streets did
not constitute a Fourth Amendment
search because “[t]here was no entry of
the houses or offices of the defendants,”
id., at 464, 48 S.Ct. 564.

Our later cases, of course, have deviated
from that exclusively property-based ap-
proach. In Katz v. United States, 389 U.S.
347, 351, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Hd.2d 576
(1967), we said that “the Fourth Amend-
ment protects people, not places,” and
found a violation in attachment of an
eavesdropping device to a public telephone
booth. Our later cases have applied the
analysis of Justice Harlan’s concurrence in
that case, which said that a violation oc-
curs when government officers violate a
person’s “reasonable expectation of priva-
ey,” id. at 360, 88 S.Ct. 507. See, eg.
Bond v. United States, 529 U.S. 334, 120
S.Ct. 1462, 146 L.Ed.2d 365 (2000); Cali-
fornia v. Ciraolo, 476 U.S. 207, 106 S.Ct.
1809, 90 L.Ed.2d 210 (1986); Smith v.
Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 99 S.Ct. 2577, 61
L.Ed.2d 220 (1979).

3. Justice ALITO’s concurrence (hereinafter
concurrence) doubts the wisdom of our ap-
proach because “‘it is almost impossible to
think of late-18th-century situations that are
analogous to what took place in this case.”
Post, at 958 (opinion concurring in judgment).
But in fact it posits a situation that is not far
afield—a constable’s concealing himself in the
target’s coach in order to track its move-
ments. Ibid. There is no doubt that the infor-
mation gained by that trespassory activity
would be the product of an unlawful search—
whether that information consisted of the
conversations occurring in the coach, or of
the destinations to which the coach traveled.

In any case, it is quite irrelevant whether
there was an 18th-century analog. Whatever

132 SUPREME COURT REPORTER

[3,4] The Government contends that
the Harlan standard shows that no search
occurred here, since Jones had no “reason-
able expectation of privacy” in the area of
the Jeep accessed by Government agents
(its underbody) and in the locations of the
Jeep on the public roads, which were visi-
ble to all. But we need not address the
Government’s contentions, because Jones’s
Fourth Amendment rights do not rise or
fall with the Katz formulation. At bottom,
we must “assur[e] preservation of that de-
gree of privacy against government that
existed when the Fourth Amendment was
adopted.” Kyllo, supra, at 34, 121 S.Ct.
2038. As explained, for most of our histo-
ry the Fourth Amendment was understood
to embody a particular concern for govern-
ment trespass upon the areas (“persons,
houses, papers, and effects”) it enumer-
ates.’ Katz did not repudiate that under-
standing. Less than two years later the
Court upheld defendants’ contention that
the Government could not introduce
against them conversations between other
people obtained by warrantless placement
of electronic surveillance devices in their
homes. The opinion rejected the dissent’s
contention that there was no Fourth
Amendment violation “unless the conversa-
tional privacy of the homeowner himself is
invaded.”* Alderman v. United States,

new methods of investigation may be devised,
our task, at a minimum, is to decide whether
the action in question would have constituted
a “search” within the original meaning of the
Fourth Amendment. Where, as here, the
Government obtains information by physical-
ly intruding on a constitutionally protected
area, such a search has undoubtedly oc-
curred.

4. Thus, the concurrence’s attempt to recast
Alderman as meaning that individuals have a
“legitimate expectation of privacy in all con-
versations that [take] place under their roof,”
post, at 960, is foreclosed by the Court’s opin-
ion. The Court took as a given that the home-
owner’s ‘‘conversational privacy” had not
been violated.

394 U.S. 165, 176, 89 S.Ct. 961, 22 L.Ed.2d

Katz, by holding that the Fourth Amend-
ment protects persons and their private
conversations, was intended to withdraw
any of the protection which the Amend-
ment extends to the home....” Jd. at

[5,6] More recently, in Soldal v. Cook
County, 506 U.S. 56, 113 S.Ct. 538, 121
L.Ed.2d 450 (1992), the Court unanimously
rejected the argument that although a
“seizure” had occurred “in a ‘technical’
sense” when a trailer home was forcibly
removed, id. at 62, 113 S.Ct. 538, no
Fourth Amendment violation occurred be-
cause law enforcement had not “invade[d]
the [individuals’] privacy,” id. at 60, 113
S.Ct. 588. Katz, the Court explained, es-
tablished that “property rights are not the
sole measure of Fourth Amendment viola-
tions,” but did not “snuf[f] out the previ-
ously recognized protection for property.”
506 US., at 64, 113 S.Ct. 538. As Justice
Brennan explained in his concurrence in
Knotts, Katz did not erode the principle
“that, when the Government does engage
in physical intrusion of a constitutionally
protected area in order to obtain informa-
tion, that intrusion may constitute a viola-
tion of the Fourth Amendment.” 460 U.S.,
at 286, 103 S.Ct. 1081 (opinion concurring
in judgment). We have embodied that

5. The concurrence notes that post-Katz we
have explained that ‘“‘‘an actual trespass is
neither necessary nor sufficient to establish a
constitutional violation.’ ’’ Post, at 960 (quot-
ing United States v. Karo, 468 U.S. 705, 713,
104 S.Ct. 3296, 82 L.Ed.2d 530 (1984)). That
is undoubtedly true, and undoubtedly irrele-
vant. Karo was considering whether a sei-
zure occurred, and as the concurrence ex-
plains, a seizure of property occurs, not when
there is a trespass, but ‘when there is some
meaningful interference with an individual’s
possessory interests in that property.’’ Post,
at 958 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Likewise with a search. Trespass alone does

preservation of past rights in our very
definition of “reasonable expectation of pri-
vacy” which we have said to be an expecta-
tion “that has a source outside of the
Fourth Amendment, either by reference to
concepts of real or personal property law
or to understandings that are recognized
and permitted by society.” Minnesota v.
Carter, 525 U.S. 83, 88, 119 S.Ct. 469, 142
L.Ed.2d 3873 (1998) (internal quotation
marks omitted). Katz did not narrow the
Fourth Amendment’s scope.°

The Government contends that several
of our post-Katz cases foreclose the conclu-
sion that what occurred here constituted a
search. It relies principally on two cases
in which we rejected Fourth Amendment
challenges to “beepers,” electronic track-
ing devices that represent another form of
electronic monitoring. The first case,
Knotts, upheld against Fourth Amendment
challenge the use of a “beeper” that had
been placed in a container of chloroform,
allowing law enforcement to monitor the
location of the container. 460 U.S., at 278,
103 S.Ct. 1081. We said that there had
been no infringement of Knotts’ reason-
able expectation of privacy since the infor-
mation obtained—the location of the auto-
mobile carrying the container on public
roads, and the location of the off-loaded
container in open fields near Knotts’ cab-
in—had been voluntarily conveyed to the

not qualify, but there must be conjoined with
that what was present here: an attempt to
find something or to obtain information.

Related to this, and similarly irrelevant, is
the concurrence’s point that, if analyzed sepa-
rately, neither the installation of the device
nor its use would constitute a Fourth Amend-
ment search. See ibid. Of course not. A
trespass on “houses” or “effects,” or a Katz
invasion of privacy, is not alone a search
unless it is done to obtain information; and
the obtaining of information is not alone a
search unless it is achieved by such a trespass
or invasion of privacy.

But as we have discussed, the Katz reason-
able-expectation-of-privacy test has been
added to, not substituted for, the common-
law trespassory test. The holding in
Knotts addressed only the former, since
the latter was not at issue. The beeper
had been placed in the container before it
came into Knotts’ possession, with the con-
sent of the then-owner. 460 U.S., at 278,
103 S.Ct. 1081. Knotts did not challenge
that installation, and we specifically de-
clined to consider its effect on the Fourth
Amendment analysis. Jd., at 279, n. **,
103 S.Ct. 1081 Knotts would be relevant,
perhaps, if the Government were making
the argument that what would otherwise
be an unconstitutional search is not such
where it produces only public information.
The Government does not make that argu-
ment, and we know of no case that would
support it.

The second “beeper” case, United States
v. Karo, 468 U.S. 705, 104 S.Ct. 3296, 82
L.Ed.2d 530 (1984), does not suggest a
different conclusion. There we addressed
the question left open by Knotts, whether
the installation of a beeper in a container
amounted to a search or seizure. 468
US., at 713, 104 S.Ct. 3296. As in Knotts,
at the time the beeper was installed the
container belonged to a third party, and it
did not come into possession of the defen-
dant until later. 468 U.S., at 708, 104
S.Ct. 3296. Thus, the specific question we
considered was whether the installation
“with the consent of the original owner
constitute[d] a search or seizure ... when
the container is delivered to a buyer hav-
ing no knowledge of the presence of the
beeper.” Jd., at 707, 104 S.Ct. 3296 (em-

phasis added). We held not. The Govern-
ment, we said, came into physical contact
with the container only before it belonged
to the defendant Karo; and the transfer of
the container with the unmonitored beeper
inside did not convey any information and
thus did not invade Karo’s privacy. See
id., at 712, 104 S.Ct. 3296. That conclu-
sion is perfectly consistent with the one we
reach here. Karo accepted the container
as it came to him, beeper and all, and was
therefore not entitled to object to the
beeper’s presence, even though it was used
to monitor the container’s location. Cf. On
Lee v. United States, 343 U.S. 747, 751-
752, 72 S.Ct. 967, 96 L.Ed. 1270 (1952) (no
search or seizure where an informant, who
was wearing a concealed microphone, was
invited into the defendant’s business).
Jones, who possessed the Jeep at the time
the Government trespassorily inserted the
information-gathering device, is on much
different footing.

The Government also points to our expo-
sition in New York v. Class, 475 U.S. 106,
106 S.Ct. 960, 89 L.Ed.2d 81 (1986), that
“Tt]he exterior of a car ... is thrust into
the public eye, and thus to examine it does
not constitute a ‘search.’” Jd., at 114, 106
S.Ct. 960. That statement is of marginal
relevance here since, as the Government
acknowledges, “the officers in this case did
more than conduct a visual inspection of
respondent’s vehicle,” Brief for United
States 41 (emphasis added). By attaching
the device to the Jeep, officers encroached
on a protected area. In Class itself we
suggested that this would make a differ-
ence, for we concluded that an officer’s
momentary reaching into the interior of a
vehicle did constitute a search.’ 475 U.S.,

practices”’ of the type that GPS tracking made
possible here, ibid.

[7] Finally, the Government’s position
gains little support from our conclusion in
Oliver v. United States, 466 U.S. 170, 104
S.Ct. 1735, 80 L.Ed.2d 214 (1984), that
officers’ information-gathering intrusion on
an “open field” did not constitute a Fourth
Amendment search even though it was a
trespass at common law, id., at 183, 104
S.Ct. 1735. Quite simply, an open field,
unlike the curtilage of a home, see United
States v. Dunn, 480 U.S. 294, 300, 107
S.Ct. 1134, 94 L.Ed.2d 326 (1987), is not
one of those protected areas enumerated
in the Fourth Amendment. Oliver, supra,

ter v. United States, 265 U.S. 57, 59, 44
S.Ct. 445, 68 L.Ed. 898 (1924). The Gov-
ernment’s physical intrusion on such an
area—unlike its intrusion on the “effect” at
issue here—is of no Fourth Amendment
significance.’

B

[8] The concurrence begins by accus-
ing us of applying “18th-century tort law.”
Post, at 957. That is a distortion. What we
apply is an 18th-century guarantee against
unreasonable searches, which we believe
must provide at a minimum the degree of
protection it afforded when it was adopted.
The concurrence does not share that belief.
It would apply exclusively Katz’s reason-
able-expectation-of-privacy test, even when

L.Ed.2d 325 (1974), in which the Court reject-
ed the claim that the inspection of an im-
pounded vehicle’s tire tread and the collection
of paint scrapings from its exterior violated
the Fourth Amendment. Whether the plurali-
ty said so because no search occurred or
because the search was reasonable is unclear.
Compare id., at 591, 94 S.Ct. 2464 (opinion of
Blackmun, J.) (‘“[Wle fail to comprehend
what expectation of privacy was infringed”),
with id., at 592, 94 S.Ct. 2464 (“Under cir-
cumstances such as these, where probable
cause exists, a warrantless examination of the
exterior of a car is not unreasonable ...”).

that eliminates rights that previously exist-
ed.

The concurrence faults our approach for
“present[ing] particularly vexing prob-
lems” in cases that do not involve physical
contact, such as those that involve the
transmission of electronic signals. Post, at
962. We entirely fail to understand that
point. For unlike the concurrence, which
would make Katz the exclusive test, we do
not make trespass the exclusive test. Sit-
uations involving merely the transmission
of electronic signals without trespass
would remain subject to Katz analysis.

In fact, it is the concurrence’s insistence
on the exclusivity of the Katz test that
needlessly leads us into “particularly vex-
ing problems” in the present case. This
Court has to date not deviated from the
understanding that mere visual observa-
tion does not constitute a search. See
Kyllo, 5383 U.S., at 31-32, 121 S.Ct. 2038.
We accordingly held in Knotts that “[a]
person traveling in an automobile on public
thoroughfares has no reasonable expecta-
tion of privacy in his movements from one
place to another.” 460 U.S., at 281, 103
S.Ct. 1081. Thus, even assuming that the
concurrence is correct to say that “[t]radi-
tional surveillance” of Jones for a 4-week
period “would have required a large team
of agents, multiple vehicles, and perhaps
aerial assistance,” post, at 963, our cases
suggest that such visual observation is con-

Amendment is concerned with “any technical
trespass that led to the gathering of evi-

stitutionally permissible. It may be that
achieving the same result through elec-
tronic means, without an accompanying
trespass, is an unconstitutional invasion of
privacy, but the present case does not
require us to answer that question.

And answering it affirmatively leads us
needlessly into additional thorny problems.
The concurrence posits that “relatively
short-term monitoring of a person’s move-
ments on public streets” is okay, but that
“the use of longer term GPS monitoring in
investigations of most offenses ” is no good.
Post, at 964 (emphasis added). That intro-
duces yet another novelty into our juris-
prudence. There is no precedent for the
proposition that whether a search has oc-
curred depends on the nature of the crime
being investigated. And even accepting
that novelty, it remains unexplained why a
4-week investigation is “surely” too long
and why a drug-trafficking conspiracy in-
volving substantial amounts of cash and
narcotics is not an “extraordinary of-
fens[e]” which may permit longer observa-
tion. See post, at 964. What of a 2-day
monitoring of a suspected purveyor of sto-
Jen electronics? Or of a 6-month monitor-
ing of a suspected terrorist? We may
have to grapple with these “vexing prob-
lems” in some future case where a classic
trespassory search is not involved and re-
sort must be had to Katz analysis; but
there is no reason for rushing forward to
resolve them here.

Il

[9] The Government argues in the al-
ternative that even if the attachment and
use of the device was a search, it was
reasonable—and thus lawful—under the
Fourth Amendment because “officers had
reasonable suspicion, and indeed probable
cause, to believe that [Jones] was a leader
in a large-scale cocaine distribution con-
spiracy.” Brief for United States 50-51.

132 SUPREME COURT REPORTER

We have no occasion to consider this argu-
ment. The Government did not raise it
below, and the D.C. Circuit therefore did
not address it. See 625 F.3d, at 767 (Gins-
burg, Tatel, and Griffith, JJ., concurring in
denial of rehearing en banc). We consider
the argument forfeited. See Sprietsma v.
Mercury Marine, 537 U.S. 51, 56, n. 4, 123
S.Ct. 518, 154 L.Ed.2d 466 (2002).

* * *

The judgment of the Court of Appeals
for the D.C. Circuit is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Justice SOTOMAYOR, concurring.

I join the Court’s opinion because I
agree that a search within the meaning of
the Fourth Amendment occurs, at a mini-
mum, “[w]here, as here, the Government
obtains information by physically intruding
on a constitutionally protected area.”
Ante, at 950, n. 8. In this case, the Govern-
ment installed a Global Positioning System
(GPS) tracking device on respondent An-
toine Jones’ Jeep without a valid warrant
and without Jones’ consent, then used that
device to monitor the Jeep’s movements
over the course of four weeks. The Gov-
ernment usurped Jones’ property for the
purpose of conducting surveillance on him,
thereby invading privacy interests long af-
forded, and undoubtedly entitled to,
Fourth Amendment protection. See, e.9.,
Silverman v. United States, 365 U.S. 505,
511-512, 81 S.Ct. 679, 5 L.Ed.2d 734
(1961).

Of course, the Fourth Amendment is
not concerned only with trespassory intru-
sions on property. See, eg, Kyllo v.
United States, 533 U.S. 27, 31-33, 121
S.Ct. 2038, 150 L.Ed.2d 94 (2001). Rath-
er, even in the absence of a trespass, “a
Fourth Amendment search occurs when
the government violates a subjective ex-
pectation of privacy that society recog-

nizes as reasonable.” Jd., at 33, 121 S.Ct.
2038; see also Smith v. Maryland, 442
US. 735, 740-741, 99 S.Ct. 2577, 61
L.Ed.2d 220 (1979); Katz v. United States,
389 U.S. 347, 361, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d
576 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring). In
Katz, this Court enlarged its then-prevail-
ing focus on property rights by announc-
ing that the reach of the Fourth Amend-
ment does not “turn upon the presence or
absence of a physical intrusion.” Jd., at
353, 88 S.Ct. 507. As the majority’s opin-
ion makes clear, however, Katz’s reason-
able-expectation-of-privacy test augment-
ed, but did not displace or diminish, the
common-law trespassory test that preced-
ed it. Ante, at 951. Thus, “when the Gov-
ernment does engage in physical intrusion
of a constitutionally protected area in or-
der to obtain information, that intrusion
may constitute a violation of the Fourth
Amendment.” United States v. Knotts,
460 U.S. 276, 286, 103 S.Ct. 1081, 75
L.Ed.2d 55 (1983) (Brennan, J., concurring
in judgment); see also, e.g. Rakas v. Illi-
nois, 439 U.S. 128, 144, n. 12, 99 S.Ct. 421,
58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978). Justice ALITO’s
approach, which discounts altogether the
constitutional relevance of the Govern-
ment’s physical intrusion on Jones’ Jeep,
erodes that longstanding protection for
privacy expectations inherent in items of
property that people possess or control.
See post, at 959-961 (opinion concurring
in judgment). By contrast, the trespasso-
ry test applied in the majority’s opinion
reflects an irreducible constitutional mini-
mum: When the Government physically
invades personal property to gather infor-
mation, a search occurs. The reaffirma-
tion of that principle suffices to decide this
case.

Nonetheless, as Justice ALITO notes,
physical intrusion is now unnecessary to
many forms of surveillance. Post, at 961-
963. With increasing regularity, the Gov-
ernment will be capable of duplicating the

monitoring undertaken in this case by en-
listing factory- or owner-installed vehicle
tracking devices or GPS-enabled smart-
phones. See United States v. Pineda-
Moreno, 617 F.3d 1120, 1125 (C.A.9 2010)
(Kozinski, C.J., dissenting from denial of
rehearing en banc). In cases of electronic
or other novel modes of surveillance that
do not depend upon a physical invasion on
property, the majority opinion’s trespasso-
ry test may provide little guidance. But
“{sjituations involving merely the trans-
mission of electronic signals without tres-
pass would remain subject to Katz analy-
Ante, at 953. As Justice ALITO
incisively observes, the same technological
advances that have made possible nontres-
passory surveillance techniques will also
affect the Katz test by shaping the evolu-
tion of societal privacy expectations. Post,
at 962-963. Under that rubric, I agree
with Justice ALITO that, at the very least,
“longer term GPS monitoring in investiga-
tions of most offenses impinges on expec-
tations of privacy.” Post, at 964.

sis.”

In cases involving even short-term moni-
toring, some unique attributes of GPS sur-
veillance relevant to the Katz analysis will
require particular attention. GPS moni-
toring generates a precise, comprehensive
record of a person’s public movements that
reflects a wealth of detail about her famil-
ial, political, professional, religious, and
sexual associations. See, eg., People v.
Weaver, 12 N.Y.3d 433, 441-442, 882
N.Y.S.2d 357, 909 N.E.2d 1195, 1199 (2009)
(“Disclosed in [GPS] data ... will be trips
the indisputably private nature of which
takes little imagination to conjure: trips to
the psychiatrist, the plastic surgeon, the
abortion clinic, the AIDS treatment center,
the strip club, the criminal defense attor-
ney, the by-the-hour motel, the union
meeting, the mosque, synagogue or
church, the gay bar and on and on”). The
956

Government can store such records and
efficiently mine them for information years
into the future. Pineda—Moreno, 617
F.3d, at 1124 (opinion of Kozinski, C.J.).
And because GPS monitoring is cheap in
comparison to conventional surveillance
techniques and, by design, proceeds sur-
reptitiously, it evades the ordinary checks
that constrain abusive law enforcement
practices: “limited police resources and
community hostility.” Illinois v. Lidster,
540 U.S. 419, 426, 124 S.Ct. 885, 157
L.Ed.2d 843 (2004).

Awareness that the Government may be
watching chills associational and expres-
sive freedoms. And the Government’s un-
restrained power to assemble data that
reveal private aspects of identity is suscep-
tible to abuse. The net result is that GPS
monitoring—by making available at a rela-
tively low cost such a substantial quantum
of intimate information about any person
whom the Government, in its unfettered
discretion, chooses to track—may “alter
the relationship between citizen and gov-
ernment in a way that is inimical to demo-
cratic society.” United States v. Cuevas—
Perez, 640 F.3d 272, 285 (C.A.7 2011)
(Flaum, J., concurring).

* United States v. Knotts, 460 U.S. 276, 103 S.Ct.
1081, 75 L.Ed.2d 55 (1983), does not fore-
close the conclusion that GPS monitoring, in
the absence of a physical intrusion, is a
Fourth Amendment search. As the majority's
opinion notes, Knotts reserved the question
whether “ ‘different constitutional principles
may be applicable’ to invasive law enforce-
ment practices such as GPS tracking. See
ante, at 952, n. 6 (quoting 460 U.S., at 284,
103 S.Ct. 1081).

United States v. Karo, 468 U.S. 705, 104
S.Ct. 3296, 82 L.Ed.2d 530 (1984), addressed
the Fourth Amendment implications of the
installation of a beeper in a container with the
consent of the container’s original owner,
who was aware that the beeper would be used
for surveillance purposes. Id., at 707, 104

I would take these attributes of GPS
monitoring into account when considering
the existence of a reasonable societal ex-
pectation of privacy in the sum of one’s
public movements. I would ask whether
people reasonably expect that their move-
ments will be recorded and aggregated in
a manner that enables the Government to
ascertain, more or less at will, their politi-
cal and religious beliefs, sexual habits, and
so on. I do not regard as dispositive the
fact that the Government might obtain the
fruits of GPS monitoring through lawful
conventional surveillance techniques. See
Kyllo, 533 US., at 35, n. 2, 121 S.Ct. 2038;
ante, at 954 (leaving open the possibility
that duplicating traditional surveillance
“through electronic means, without an ac-
companying trespass, is an unconstitution-
al invasion of privacy”). I would also con-
sider the appropriateness of entrusting to
the Executive, in the absence of any over-
sight from a coordinate branch, a tool so
amenable to misuse, especially in light of
the Fourth Amendment’s goal to curb ar-
bitrary exercises of police power to and
prevent “a too permeating police surveil-
lance,” United States v. Di Re, 332 US.

More fundamentally, it may be neces-
sary to reconsider the premise that an
individual has no reasonable expectation of
privacy in information voluntarily disclosed
to third parties. E.g. Smith, 442 U.S., at
742, 99 S.Ct. 2577; United States v. Mil-
ler, 425 U.S. 435, 443, 96 S.Ct. 1619, 48
L.Ed.2d 71 (1976). This approach is ill
suited to the digital age, in which people
reveal a great deal of information about
themselves to third parties in the course of
carrying out mundane tasks. People dis-
close the phone numbers that they dial or
text to their cellular providers; the URLs
that they visit and the e-mail addresses
with which they correspond to their Inter-
net service providers; and the books, gro-
ceries, and medications they purchase to
online retailers. Perhaps, as Justice ALI-
TO notes, some people may find the
“tradeoff” of privacy for convenience
“worthwhile,” or come to accept this “dimi-
nution of privacy” as “inevitable,” post, at
962, and perhaps not. I for one doubt that
people would accept without complaint the
warrantless disclosure to the Government
of a list of every Web site they had visited
in the last week, or month, or year. But
whatever the societal expectations, they
can attain constitutionally protected status
only if our Fourth Amendment jurispru-
dence ceases to treat secrecy as a prereq-
uisite for privacy. I would not assume
that all information voluntarily disclosed to
some member of the public for a limited
purpose is, for that reason alone, disen-
titled to Fourth Amendment protection.
See Smith, 442 US., at 749, 99 S.Ct. 2577

tels could be maintained if there was a viola-
tion of “the dignitary interest in the inviolabil-

discrete commodity, possessed absolutely

facts to a bank or phone company for a
limited business purpose need not assume
that this information will be released to
other persons for other purposes”); see

507 (“[W]hat [a person] seeks to preserve
as private, even in an area accessible to
the public, may be constitutionally protect-
ed”).

Resolution of these difficult questions in
this case is unnecessary, however, because
the Government’s physical intrusion on
Jones’ Jeep supplies a narrower basis for
decision. I therefore join the majority’s
opinion.

Justice ALITO, with whom Justice
GINSBURG, Justice BREYER, and
Justice KAGAN join, concurring in the
judgment.

This case requires us to apply the
Fourth Amendment’s prohibition of unrea-
sonable searches and seizures to a 21st-
century surveillance technique, the use of
a Global Positioning System (GPS) device
to monitor a vehicle’s movements for an
extended period of time. Ironically, the
Court has chosen to decide this case based
on 18th-century tort law. By attaching a
small GPS device! to the underside of the
vehicle that respondent drove, the law en-
forcement officers in this case engaged in
conduct that might have provided grounds
in 1791 for a suit for trespass to chattels.
And for this reason, the Court concludes,

ity of chattels,” but today there must be
“some actual damage to the chattel before the
action can be maintained.” W. Keeton, D.
Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser &
Keeton on Law of Torts 87 (5th ed.1984)
(hereinafter Prosser & Keeton). Here, there
was no actual damage to the vehicle to which
the GPS device was attached.
958

the installation and use of the GPS device
constituted a search. Ante, at 948-949.

This holding, in my judgment, is unwise.
It strains the language of the Fourth
Amendment; it has little if any support in
current Fourth Amendment case law; and
it is highly artificial.

I would analyze the question presented
in this case by asking whether respon-
dent’s reasonable expectations of privacy
were violated by the long-term monitoring
of the movements of the vehicle he drove.

I

A

The Fourth Amendment prohibits “un-
reasonable searches and seizures,” and the
Court makes very little effort to explain
how the attachment or use of the GPS
device fits within these terms. The Court
does not contend that there was a seizure.
A seizure of property occurs when there is
“some meaningful interference with an in-
dividual’s possessory interests in that
property,” United States v. Jacobsen, 466
US. 109, 113, 104 S.Ct. 1652, 80 L.Ed.2d
85 (1984), and here there was none. In-
deed, the success of the surveillance tech-
nique that the officers employed was de-
pendent on the fact that the GPS did not
interfere in any way with the operation of
the vehicle, for if any such interference
had been detected, the device might have
been discovered.

The Court does claim that the installa-
tion and use of the GPS constituted a
search, see ante, at 948-949, but this
conclusion is dependent on the questiona-
ble proposition that these two procedures
cannot be separated for purposes of
Fourth Amendment analysis. If these two
procedures are analyzed separately, it is

3. The Court suggests that something like this
might have occurred in 1791, but this would
have required either a gigantic coach, a very

not at all clear from the Court’s opinion
why either should be regarded as a search.
It is clear that the attachment of the GPS
device was not itself a search; if the device
had not functioned or if the officers had
not used it, no information would have
been obtained. And the Court does not
contend that the use of the device consti-
tuted a search either. On the contrary,
the Court accepts the holding in United
States v. Knotts, 460 U.S. 276, 103 S.Ct.
1081, 75 L.Ed.2d 55 (1983), that the use of
a surreptitiously planted electronic device
to monitor a vehicle’s movements on public
roads did not amount to a search. See
ante, at 951.

The Court argues—and I agree—that
“Wwe must ‘assur[e] preservation of that
degree of privacy against government that
existed when the Fourth Amendment was
adopted.’” Ante, at 950 (quoting Kyllo v.
United States, 533 U.S. 27, 34, 121 S.Ct.
2038, 150 L.Ed.2d 94 (2001)). But it is
almost impossible to think of late-18th-
century situations that are analogous to
what took place in this case. (Is it possi-
ble to imagine a case in which a constable
secreted himself somewhere in a coach and
remained there for a period of time in
order to monitor the movements of the
coach’s owner?*) The Court’s theory
seems to be that the concept of a search,
as originally understood, comprehended
any technical trespass that led to the gath-
ering of evidence, but we know that this is
incorrect. At common law, any unautho-
rized intrusion on private property was
actionable, see Prosser & Keeton 75, but a
trespass on open fields, as opposed to the
“curtilage” of a home, does not fall within
the scope of the Fourth Amendment be-
cause private property outside the curti-

tiny constable, or both—not to mention a con-
stable with incredible fortitude and patience.

lage is not part of a “hous[e]” within the
meaning of the Fourth Amendment. See
Oliver v. United States, 466 U.S. 170, 104
S.Ct. 1735, 80 L.Ed.2d 214 (1984); Hester
v. United States, 265 U.S. 57, 44 S.Ct. 445,
68 L.Ed. 898 (1924).

B

The Court’s reasoning in this case is
very similar to that in the Court’s early
decisions involving wiretapping and elec-
tronic eavesdropping, namely, that a tech-
nical trespass followed by the gathering of
evidence constitutes a search. In the ear-
ly electronic surveillance cases, the Court
concluded that a Fourth Amendment
search occurred when private conversa-
tions were monitored as a result of an
“unauthorized physical penetration into
the premises occupied” by the defendant.
Silverman v. United States, 365 U.S. 505,
509, 81 S.Ct. 679, 5 L.Ed.2d 734 (1961). In
Silverman, police officers listened to con-
versations in an attached home by insert-
ing a “spike mike” through the wall that
this house shared with the vacant house
next door. Id., at 506, 81 S.Ct. 679. This
procedure was held to be a search because
the mike made contact with a heating duct
on the other side of the wall and thus
“usurp[ed] an integral part of the
premises.” Jd., at 511, 81 S.Ct. 679.

By contrast, in cases in which there was
no trespass, it was held that there was no
search. Thus, in Olmstead v. United
States, 277 U.S. 488, 48 S.Ct. 564, 72 L.Ed.
944 (1928), the Court found that the
Fourth Amendment did not apply because
“t]he taps from house lines were made in
the streets near the houses.” Jd., at 457,
48 S.Ct. 564. Similarly, the Court conclud-
ed that no search occurred in Goldman v.
United States, 316 U.S. 129, 135, 62 S.Ct.
993, 86 L.Ed. 1322 (1942), where a “detec-
taphone” was placed on the outer wall of
defendant’s office for the purpose of over-

hearing conversations held within the
room.

This trespass-based rule was repeatedly
criticized. In Olmstead, Justice Brandeis
wrote that it was “immaterial where the
physical connection with the telephone
wires was made.” 277 U.S., at 479, 48
S.Ct. 564 (dissenting opinion). Although a
private conversation transmitted by wire
did not fall within the literal words of the
Fourth Amendment, he argued, the
Amendment should be understood as pro-
hibiting “every unjustifiable intrusion by
the government upon the privacy of the
individual.” Jd., at 478, 48 S.Ct. 564. See
also, e.g. Silverman, supra, at 513, 81
S.Ct. 679 (Douglas, J., concurring) (“The
concept of ‘an unauthorized physical pen-
etration into the premises,’ on which the
present decision rests seems to me beside
the point. Was not the wrong ... done
when the intimacies of the home were
tapped, recorded, or revealed? The depth
of the penetration of the electronic de-
vice—even the degree of its remoteness
from the inside of the house—is not the
measure of the injury”); Goldman, supra,
at 139, 62 S.Ct. 993 (Murphy, J., dissent-
ing) (“[T]Jhe search of one’s home or office
no longer requires physical entry, for sci-
ence has brought forth far more effective
devices for the invasion of a person’s priva-
cy than the direct and obvious methods of
oppression which were detested by our
forebears and which inspired the Fourth
Amendment”).

Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 88
S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967), finally
did away with the old approach, holding
that a trespass was not required for a
Fourth Amendment violation. Katz in-
volved the use of a listening device that
was attached to the outside of a public
telephone booth and that allowed police
officers to eavesdrop on one end of the
target’s phone conversation. This proce-
960

dure did not physically intrude on the area
occupied by the target, but the Katz Court,
“repudiate[ed]” the old doctrine, Rakas v.
Illinois, 439 U.S. 128, 143, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58
L.Ed.2d 387 (1978), and held that “[t]he
fact that the electronic device employed
... did not happen to penetrate the wall of
the booth can have no constitutional signif-
icance,” 389 U.S., at 353, 88 S.Ct. 507
(“T]he reach of th{e] [Fourth] Amend-
ment cannot turn upon the presence or
absence of a physical intrusion into any
given enclosure”); see Rakas, supra, at
148, 99 S.Ct. 421 (describing Katz as hold-
ing that the “capacity to claim the protec-
tion for the Fourth Amendment depends
not upon a property right in the invaded
place but upon whether the person who
claims the protection of the Amendment
has a legitimate expectation of privacy in
the invaded place”); Kyllo, supra, at 32,
121 S.Ct. 2038 (“We have since decoupled
violation of a person’s Fourth Amendment
rights from trespassory violation of his
property”). What mattered, the Court
now held, was whether the conduct at is-
sue “violated the privacy upon which [the
defendant] justifiably relied while using
the telephone booth.” Katz, supra, at 353,
88 S.Ct. 507.

Under this approach, as the Court later
put it when addressing the relevance of a
technical trespass, “an actual trespass is
neither necessary nor sufficient to estab-
lish a constitutional violation.” United
States v. Karo, 468 U.S. 705, 713, 104 S.Ct.
3296, 82 L.Ed.2d 530 (1984) (emphasis add-
ed). Ibid. (“Compar[ing] Katz v. United
States, 389 U.S. 347 [88 S.Ct. 507, 19
L.Ed.2d 576] (1967) (no trespass, but
Fourth Amendment violation), with Oliver
v. United States, 466 U.S. 170 [104 S.Ct.
1735, 80 L.Ed.2d 214] (1984) (trespass, but
no Fourth Amendment violation)”). In Ol-
wer, the Court wrote:

“The existence of a property right is but

one element in determining whether ex-

132 SUPREME COURT REPORTER

pectations of privacy are legitimate.
‘The premise that property interests
control the right of the Government to
search and seize has been discredited.’
Katz, 389 U.S., at 353 [88 S.Ct. 507],
(quoting Warden v. Hayden, 387 US.
294, 304 [87 S.Ct. 1642, 18 L.Ed.2d 782]
(1967); some internal quotation marks
omitted).” 466 U.S., at 183, 104 S.Ct.
1735.

I

The majority suggests that two post-
Katz decisions—Soldal v. Cook County,
506 U.S. 56, 113 S.Ct. 538, 121 L.Ed.2d 450
(1992), and Alderman v. United States, 394
US. 165, 89 S.Ct. 961, 22 L.Ed.2d 176
(1969)—show that a technical trespass is
sufficient to establish the existence of a
search, but they provide little support.

In Soldal, the Court held that towing
away a trailer home without the owner’s
consent constituted a seizure even if this
did not invade the occupants’ personal pri-
vacy. But in the present case, the Court
does not find that there was a seizure, and
it is clear that none occurred.

In Alderman, the Court held that the
Fourth Amendment rights of homeowners
were implicated by the use of a surrepti-
tiously planted listening device to monitor
third-party conversations that occurred
within their home. See 394 US., at 176-
180, 89 S.Ct. 961. Alderman is best un-
derstood to mean that the homeowners
had a legitimate expectation of privacy in
all conversations that took place under
their roof. See Rakas, 439 U.S., at 144, n.
12, 99 S.Ct. 421 (citing Alderman for the
proposition that “the Court has not alto-
gether abandoned use of property concepts
in determining the presence or absence of
the privacy interests protected by that
Amendment”); 439 U.S., at 153, 99 S.Ct.
421 (Powell, J., concurring) (citing Alder-
US. v. JONES

961

Cite as 132 S.Ct. 945 (2012)

man for the proposition that “property
rights reflect society’s explicit recognition
of a person’s authority to act as he wishes
in certain areas, and therefore should be
considered in determining whether an indi-
vidual’s expectations of privacy are reason-
able”); Karo, supra, at 732, 104 S.Ct. 3296
(Stevens, J., concurring in part and dis-
senting in part) (citing Alderman in sup-
port of the proposition that “a homeowner
has a reasonable expectation of privacy in
the contents of his home, including items
owned by others”).

In sum, the majority is hard pressed to
find support in post-Katz cases for its tres-
pass-based theory.

Il

Disharmony with a substantial body of
existing case law is only one of the prob-
lems with the Court’s approach in this
case.

I will briefly note four others. First,
the Court’s reasoning largely disregards
what is really important (the use of a GPS
for the purpose of long-term tracking) and
instead attaches great significance to
something that most would view as rela-
tively minor (attaching to the bottom of a
car a small, light object that does not
interfere in any way with the car’s opera-
tion). Attaching such an object is general-
ly regarded as so trivial that it does not
provide a basis for recovery under modern
tort law. See Prosser & Keeton § 14, at
87 (harmless or trivial contact with person-
al property not actionable); D. Dobbs,
Law of Torts 124 (2000) (same). But un-
der the Court’s reasoning, this conduct
may violate the Fourth Amendment. By
contrast, if long-term monitoring can be
accomplished without committing a techni-
cal trespass—suppose, for example, that

4. See, e.g., Cal. Family Code Ann. § 760 (West
2004).

the Federal Government required or per-
suaded auto manufacturers to include a
GPS tracking device in every car—the
Court’s theory would provide no protec-
tion.

Second, the Court’s approach leads to
incongruous results. If the police attach a
GPS device to a car and use the device to
follow the car for even a brief time, under
the Court’s theory, the Fourth Amend-
ment applies. But if the police follow the
same car for a much longer period using
unmarked cars and aerial assistance, this
tracking is not subject to any Fourth
Amendment constraints.

In the present case, the Fourth Amend-
ment applies, the Court concludes, because
the officers installed the GPS device after
respondent’s wife, to whom the car was
registered, turned it over to respondent
for his exclusive use. See ante, at 951.
But if the GPS had been attached prior to
that time, the Court’s theory would lead to
a different result. The Court proceeds on
the assumption that respondent “had at
least the property rights of a bailee,” ante,
at 949, n. 2, but a bailee may sue for a
trespass to chattel only if the injury occurs
during the term of the bailment. See 8A
Am.Jur.2d, Bailment § 166, pp. 685-686
(2009). So if the GPS device had been
installed before respondent’s wife gave
him the keys, respondent would have no
claim for trespass—and, presumably, no
Fourth Amendment claim either.

Third, under the Court’s theory, the cov-
erage of the Fourth Amendment may vary
from State to State. If the events at issue
here had occurred in a community proper-
ty State‘ or a State that has adopted the
Uniform Marital Property Act,> respon-
dent would likely be an owner of the vehi-
cle, and it would not matter whether the

5. See Uniform Marital Property Act § 4, 9A
U.L.A. 116 (1998).
962

GPS was installed before or after his wife
turned over the keys. In non-community-
property States, on the other hand, the
registration of the vehicle in the name of
respondent’s wife would generally be re-
garded as presumptive evidence that she
was the sole owner. See 60 C.J. S., Motor
Vehicles § 231, pp. 398-399 (2002); 8 Am.
Jur.2d, Automobiles § 1208, pp. 859-860
(2007).

Fourth, the Court’s reliance on the law
of trespass will present particularly vexing
problems in cases involving surveillance
that is carried out by making electronic, as
opposed to physical, contact with the item
to be tracked. For example, suppose that
the officers in the present case had fol-
lowed respondent by surreptitiously acti-
vating a stolen vehicle detection system
that came with the car when it was pur-
chased. Would the sending of a radio
signal to activate this system constitute a
trespass to chattels? Trespass to chattels
has traditionally required a physical touch-
ing of the property. See Restatement
(Second) of Torts § 217 and Comment e
(1963 and 1964); Dobbs, supra, at 123. In
recent years, courts have wrestled with the
application of this old tort in cases involv-
ing unwanted electronic contact with com-
puter systems, and some have held that
even the transmission of electrons that
occurs when a communication is sent from
one computer to another is enough. See,
e.g, CompuServe, Inc. v. Cyber Pro-
motions, Inc., 962 F.Supp. 1015, 1021
(S.D.Ohio 1997); Thrifty-Tel, Inc. v. Bez-
enek, 46 Cal.App.4th 1559, 1566, n. 6, 54
Cal.Rptr.2d 468 (1996). But may such de-
cisions be followed in applying the Court’s
trespass theory? Assuming that what
matters under the Court’s theory is the

law of trespass as it existed at the time of
the adoption of the Fourth Amendment, do
these recent decisions represent a change
in the law or simply the application of the
old tort to new situations?

IV

A

The Katz expectation-of-privacy test
avoids the problems and complications
noted above, but it is not without its own
difficulties. It involves a degree of circu-
larity, see Kyllo, 533 US., at 34, 121 S.Ct.
2038, and judges are apt to confuse their
own expectations of privacy with those of
the hypothetical reasonable person to
which the Katz test looks. See Minneso-
ta v. Carter, 525 U.S. 88, 97, 119 S.Ct.
469, 142 L.Ed.2d 373 (1998) (SCALIA, J.,
concurring). In addition, the Katz test
rests on the assumption that this hypo-
thetical reasonable person has a well-de-
veloped and stable set of privacy expecta-
tions. But technology can change those
expectations. Dramatic technological
change may lead to periods in which pop-
ular expectations are in flux and may ulti-
mately produce significant changes in
popular attitudes. New technology may
provide increased convenience or security
at the expense of privacy, and many peo-
ple may find the tradeoff worthwhile.
And even if the public does not welcome
the diminution of privacy that new tech-
nology entails, they may eventually recon-
cile themselves to this development as in-
evitable.®

On the other hand, concern about new
intrusions on privacy may spur the enact-
ment of legislation to protect against these
intrusions. This is what ultimately hap-

pened with respect to wiretapping. After
Katz, Congress did not leave it to the
courts to develop a body of Fourth Amend-
ment case law governing that complex sub-
ject. Instead, Congress promptly enacted
a comprehensive statute, see 18 U.S.C.
§§ 2510-2522 (2006 ed. and Supp. IV), and
since that time, the regulation of wiretap-
ping has been governed primarily by stat-
ute and not by case law.’ In an ironic
sense, although Katz overruled Olmstead,
Chief Justice Taft’s suggestion in the lat-
ter case that the regulation of wiretapping
was a matter better left for Congress, see
277 US., at 465-466, 48 S.Ct. 564, has
been borne out.

B

Recent years have seen the emergence
of many new devices that permit the moni-
toring of a person’s movements. In some
locales, closed-circuit television video moni-
toring is becoming ubiquitous. On toll
roads, automatic toll collection systems
create a precise record of the movements
of motorists who choose to make use of
that convenience. Many motorists pur-
chase cars that are equipped with devices
that permit a central station to ascertain
the car’s location at any time so that road-
side assistance may be provided if needed
and the car may be found if it is stolen.

Perhaps most significant, cell phones
and other wireless devices now permit
wireless carriers to track and record the
location of users—and as of June 2011, it

has been reported, there were more than
322 million wireless devices in use in the
United States.’ For older phones, the ac-
curacy of the location information depends
on the density of the tower network, but
new “smart phones,” which are equipped
with a GPS device, permit more precise
tracking. For example, when a user acti-
vates the GPS on such a phone, a provider
is able to monitor the phone’s location and
speed of movement and can then report
back real-time traffic conditions after com-
bining (“crowdsourcing”) the speed of all
such phones on any particular road.? Sim-
ilarly, phone-location-tracking services are
offered as “social” tools, allowing consum-
ers to find (or to avoid) others who enroll
in these services. The availability and use
of these and other new devices will contin-
ue to shape the average person’s expecta-
tions about the privacy of his or her daily
movements.

Vv

In the pre-computer age, the greatest
protections of privacy were neither consti-
tutional nor statutory, but practical. Tra-
ditional surveillance for any extended peri-
od of time was difficult and costly and
therefore rarely undertaken. The surveil-
lance at issue in this case—constant moni-
toring of the location of a vehicle for four
weeks—would have required a large team
of agents, multiple vehicles, and perhaps
aerial assistance. Only an investigation
of unusual importance could have justified
such an expenditure of law enforcement

10. Even with a radio transmitter like those
used in United States v. Knotts, 460 U.S. 276,
103 S.Ct. 1081, 75 L.Ed.2d 55 (1983), or
United States v. Karo, 468 U.S. 705, 104 S.Ct.
3296, 82 L.Ed.2d 530 (1984), such long-term
surveillance would have been exceptionally
demanding. The beepers used in those cases
merely “‘emit[ted] periodic signals that [could]
be picked up by a radio receiver.’”’ Knotts,
460 U.S., at 277, 103 S.Ct. 1081. The signal
had a limited range and could be lost if the
police did not stay close enough. Indeed, in

resources. Devices like the one used in
the present case, however, make long-term
monitoring relatively easy and cheap. In
circumstances involving dramatic techno-
logical change, the best solution to privacy
concerns may be legislative. See, e.9.,
Kerr, 102 Mich. L.Rev., at 805-806. A
legislative body is well situated to gauge
changing public attitudes, to draw detailed
lines, and to balance privacy and public
safety in a comprehensive way.

To date, however, Congress and most
States have not enacted statutes regulat-
ing the use of GPS tracking technology for
law enforcement purposes. The best that
we can do in this case is to apply existing
Fourth Amendment doctrine and to ask
whether the use of GPS tracking in a
particular case involved a degree of intru-
sion that a reasonable person would not
have anticipated.

Under this approach, relatively short-
term monitoring of a person’s movements
on public streets accords with expecta-
tions of privacy that our society has rec-
ognized as reasonable. See Knotts, 460
US., at 281-282, 103 S.Ct. 1081. But the
use of longer term GPS monitoring in in-
vestigations of most offenses impinges on
expectations of privacy. For such of-
fenses, society’s expectation has been that
law enforcement agents and others would
not—and indeed, in the main, simply
could not—secretly monitor and catalogue
every single movement of an individual’s

Knotts itself, officers lost the signal from the
beeper, and only “with the assistance of a
monitoring device located in a_ helicopter
[was] the approximate location of the signal
... picked up again about one hour later.”
Id., at 278, 103 S.Ct. 1081.

11. In this case, the agents obtained a warrant,
but they did not comply with two of the
warrant’s restrictions: They did not install the
GPS device within the 10-day period required
by the terms of the warrant and by Fed. Rule
Crim. Proc. 41(e)(2)(B)(i), and they did not
install the GPS device within the District of

car for a very long period. In this case,
for four weeks, law enforcement agents
tracked every movement that respondent
made in the vehicle he was driving. We
need not identify with precision the point
at which the tracking of this vehicle be-
came a search, for the line was surely
crossed before the 4-week mark. Other
cases may present more difficult ques-
tions. But where uncertainty exists with
respect to whether a certain period of
GPS surveillance is long enough to consti-
tute a Fourth Amendment search, the po-
lice may always seek a warrant.’ We
also need not consider whether prolonged
GPS monitoring in the context of investi-
gations involving extraordinary offenses
would similarly intrude on a constitution-
ally protected sphere of privacy. In such
cases, long-term tracking might have been
mounted using previously available tech-

niques.
* * *

For these reasons, I conclude that the
lengthy monitoring that occurred in this
case constituted a search under the Fourth
Amendment. I therefore agree with the
majority that the decision of the Court of
Appeals must be affirmed.

Columbia, as required by the terms of the

41(b)(4). In the courts below the Govern-
ment did not argue, and has not argued here,
that the Fourth Amendment does not impose
these precise restrictions and that the viola-
tion of these restrictions does not demand the
suppression of evidence obtained using the
tracking device. See, e.g., United States v.
