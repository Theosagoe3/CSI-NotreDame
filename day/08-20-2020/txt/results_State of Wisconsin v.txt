921 The viability or scope of the four-
corners rule requires a clear answer from
our supreme court. The four-corners rule
as defined by the majority allows a litigant
who is not a party to a contract of insur-
ance to unilaterally control whether a con-
tract (the insurance policy) provides cover-
age when that litigant has no privity in the
contract.

_Ly:1 22 A simple example suffices: Plain-
tiff Doe files a complaint with the sole
allegation that Defendant Doe intentional-
ly struck him causing injuries. Defendant
Doe’s insurer refuses, pursuant to the
four-corners rule, to provide a defense or
coverage as the policy expressly precludes
coverage for intentional acts. The true
facts, however, are that Plaintiff Doe was
an intruder into Defendant Doe’s home
and Defendant Doe injured Plaintiff Doe in
the course of defending himself. The rigid
application of the four-corners rule does
not allow Defendant Doe to challenge
Plaintiff Doe’s characterization of the dis-
pute as it relates to the question of insur-
ance applicability.

23 In this case, Water Well presented
evidence that it used a subcontractor to
cut and rethread the pipe for the well
pump. All of the damages alleged in the
complaint against Water Well were caused
by the unthreading of the well pump from
the pipe column. As Water Well present-
ed evidence that the damages alleged in
the complaint were arguably not a result
of its work or product, but instead that of
a subcontractor, it should have been pro-
vided a defense by Consolidated and possi-
bly coverage. Because of the application
of the four-corners rule, however, Consoli-
dated successfully argued that it was ab-
solved from providing both the defense
and coverage that it had promised Water
Well by contract that it would provide.

} Petition for review denied.

124 I dissent as Water Well, a party to
the insurance contract, should be allowed
to present facts to the court relevant to
the issue of whether a policy of insurance
provides coverage. It is absurd to allow
an entity that has no privity of contract to
dictate whether the contract provides de-
fense and coverage.

text messages delivered to Wilson’s phone.
We affirm.

BACKGROUND

12 At the preliminary hearing, Delafield
police officer Landon Nyren testified that
on December 5, 2012, he responded to a
call about a death and found the body of
Wayne Wilson. Wilson had a small plastic
object in his mouth, which turned out to be
a fentanyl patch. The Waukesha County
Medical Examiner testified that fentanyl
was a substantial factor in Wilson’s death
and was the immediate cause of his death.
On the autopsy report, the examiner listed
acute fentanyl intoxication as the cause of
death.

13 Nyren testified that, while at Wil-
son’s residence, he found Wilson’s phone
and retrieved text messages from it, in-
cluding texts sent and received the |,,day
before Wilson’s death. There were mes-
sages between Wilson and Tentoni discuss-
ing Tentoni obtaining fentanyl patches for
Wilson. After Wilson sent Tentoni a mes-
sage indicating that some patches “are like
duds to me” and that he did not “feel a
thing,” there was a text from Tentoni to
Wilson suggesting that Wilson suck on a
patch. A subsequent message from Tento-
ni to Wilson described how to fold the
patch, and Nyren testified that the folding
method described in the text was consis-
tent with the position of the patch on
Wilson’s body when he was found.

14 Tentoni’s counsel represented to the
court, at the hearing on his motion to
suppress, that, relying on the information
contained in the text messages on Wilson’s
phone from Tentoni, Nyren obtained a

1. The search warrant and resulting phone
records are not in the record on appeal. The
State conceded at the motion hearing that
text messages found on Wilson’s phone at the

warrant for Tentoni’s phone records relat-
ing to the number he used to text Wilson,
including 350 text messages between Ten-
toni and Wilson in the month of November
and into the first week of December and
around four thousand text messages in all.!

15 Tentoni moved to suppress the text
messages found on Wilson’s phone and
those obtained with the warrant. The cir-
cuit court denied the motion, finding that
Tentoni had not made a showing of a
reasonable expectation of privacy in infor-
mation that he sent to Wilson. Tentoni
pleaded guilty to an amended charge of
second-degree reckless homicide, was con-
victed, and now appeals.

_lysDISCUSSION

Standard of Review

[1,2] 16 On review of a circuit court’s
decision on a motion to suppress, we up-
hold the circuit court’s findings of fact
unless they are clearly erroneous. See
State v. Richardson, 156 Wis.2d 128, 187,
456 N.W.2d 830 (1990). Whether these
facts demonstrate that constitutional prin-
ciples have been complied with is a ques-
tion of law we review de novo. Jd. at 137-
38, 456 N.W.2d 830.

Reasonable Expectation of Privacy

[3-8] 17 “The Fourth Amendment
provides that ‘people [are] to be secure in
their persons, houses, papers, and effects,
against unreasonable searches and _ sei-
zures and [that] no Warrants shall
issue, but upon probable cause... .’” State
v. Martwick, 2000 WI 5, 1126, 231 Wis.2d

amend. IV; alteration in original); see also

Tentoni and subsequently to obtain a search
warrant for Tentoni’s phone records.
288 Wis.

Wis. Const. art. 1, § 112 Fourth Amend-
ment rights are personal and may not be
asserted vicariously. State v. Bruski, 2007
WI 25, 122 n. 3, 299 Wis.2d 177, 727
N.W.2d 503 (citing Rakas v. Illinois, 439
USS. 128, 133-34, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d
387 (1978)). In order to have standing to
challenge a search on Fourth Amendment
grounds, a defendant must have “a legiti-
mate expectation of privacy” in the ],,;area
or items subjected to a search. See State
v. Trecroci, 2001 WI App 126, 126, 246
Wis.2d 261, 630 N.W.2d 555.3 The defen-
dant bears the burden of showing, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that he or
she had a reasonable expectation of priva-
cy. Id, 135. The defendant must show
two things: (1) that he or she had an
actual, subjective expectation of privacy in
the area searched and item seized and (2)
that society is willing to recognize the de-
fendant’s expectation of privacy as reason-
able. Jd. With regard to the second, ob-
jective, prong, the Trecroci court set forth
six factors relevant to the determination of
whether a person has a recognizable, rea-
sonable expectation of privacy:

1. Whether the person had a property

interest in the premises;

2. Whether the person was legitimately
on the premises;
Whether the person had complete
dominion and control and the right
to exclude others;

2. The Wisconsin Supreme Court “generally
follows the United States Supreme Court's
interpretation of the search and seizure provi-
sion of the Fourth Amendment in construing
Article I, Section 11 of the Wisconsin Consti-
tution.” State v. Bruski, 2007 WI 25, 120 n.
1, 299 Wis.2d 177, 727 N.W.2d 503.

3. Although State v. Trecroci, 2001 WI App
126, 246 Wis.2d 261, 630 N.W.2d 555, was
about a reasonable expectation of privacy in a
place, and Tentoni argues that he had a rea-
sonable expectation of privacy in the content
of the text conversations stored as messages
in Wilson’s phone, not in the phone per se,

871 NORTH WESTERN REPORTER, 2d SERIES

Whether the person took precau-
tions customarily taken by those
seeking privacy;

5. Whether the person put the proper-
ty to some private use; and

6. Whether the claim of privacy is con-
sistent with historical notions of pri-
vacy.

_Lys/d., 136. These factors are not control-
ling, and the list is not exclusive. State v.
Guard, 2012 WI App 8, 117, 338 Wis.2d
385, 808 N.W.2d 718 (2011). Whether an
individual has a reasonable expectation of
privacy is determined by examining the
totality of the circumstances. Id.

18 Addressing the factors applicable to
this case, we conclude that under the total-
ity of circumstances Tentoni did not have
an objectively reasonable expectation of
privacy in text messages contained in Wil-
son’s phone.’ First, Tentoni had no prop-
erty interest in Wilson’s phone. Second,
Tentoni had no control over Wilson’s
phone or any right to exclude others from
text messages he had sent to Wilson and
which were stored in Wilson’s phone.
Tentoni had no control over what Wilson
did with Tentoni’s text messages. Third,
Tentoni did not claim that he took any
steps to enhance the privacy of his text
messages to Wilson or that he ever told
Wilson to keep those messages private.
See State v. Duchow, 2008 WI 57, 133, 310

this distinction does not negate the applicabil-
ity of Trecroci, which provides guidance on
whether Tentoni had a reasonable expectation
of privacy. Tentoni concedes that there is no
analogous list of privacy factors tailored to
text messages.

4. Because the second part of the test, i.e.,
whether the asserted expectation of privacy
was objectively reasonable, is dispositive, we
need not address whether Tentoni had a sub-
jective expectation of privacy in the text mes-
sages.

5. Tentoni is correct that courts have recog-
nized an expectation of privacy in text mes-
sages on a cell phone—an expectation that
belongs to the owner or user of the phone.
See, e.g., Riley v. California, — U.S. , 134
S.Ct. 2473, 2495, 189 L.Ed.2d 430 (2014)
(holding that law enforcement generally must
obtain a warrant to search digital information
on a cell phone seized incident to arrest).
Riley does not help Tentoni, however, because

 

there the defendants themselves, owners of
the cell phones that were searched, chal-
lenged the searches. Jd. at 2480-81. This is
true about all of Tentoni’s cited cases—the
person who had the phone was the owner, the
exclusive user, or a permissive user in posses-
sion of the phone. See City of Ontario v.
Quon, 560 U.S. 746, 760, 764-65, 130 S.Ct.

110 Patino is on all fours with our case,
setting forth a comprehensive and persua-
sive expectation of privacy analysis consis-
tent with that applied in Wisconsin cases.
Patino had sent text messages to his girl-
friend, some of which were inculpatory
regarding the death of her son. Patino,
93 A.3d at 42, 45. The court noted that
the most important factor in determining»,
whether a person has a reasonable expec-
tation of privacy in text messages is from
whose phone the messages are accessed.
“Underlying this consideration is the ele-
ment of control; that is to say, when the
recipient receives the message, the sender
relinquishes control over what becomes of
that message on the recipient’s phone.”
Id. at 55. Because the text messages were
found on the girlfriend’s phone, and she
had full control over whether to share or
disseminate the sender’s text messages,
Patino “did not have an objectively reason-
able expectation of privacy in any text
messages contained in [the girlfriend’s]
phone, whether sent by defendant, sent to
defendant, or otherwise.” Jd. at 57.

{11 Here, Tentoni neither exerted nor
maintained any control over Wilson’s
phone or the copies of text messages that
he had sent to Wilson and were stored in
Wilson’s phone. Tentoni presented no evi-
dence that he could access the copies of
the texts he sent to Wilson or control the

right to text messages found on another's
phone.

6. Regarding Tentoni’s citation of the Wiscon-
sin Electronic Surveillance Control Law, Wis.
Star. §§ 968.27-968.375 (2013-14), as an in-
dication of a legislative intent to protect text
messages, Tentoni did not raise this argument
below, nor does he develop any argument that
the law applies here or gives rise to a reason-

content of Wilson’s phone in any way.
Once Tentoni sent the messages to Wilson
and Wilson received them, Tentoni had no
control over whether Wilson saved them,
deleted them, forwarded them to others or
shared their content in any way. This lack
of control over the message once it reaches
the recipient is analogous to the lack of
control a sender has over a piece of mail or
e-mail once it reaches the recipient, where
it may be saved, destroyed or deleted,
shared, or disclosed to others. This lack
of control over what is done with the text
message and lack of any right to exclude
others from reading it are key in the de-
termination that Tentoni did not have an
objectively reasonable expectation of priva-
cy in the text messages stored in Wilson’s
phone.
