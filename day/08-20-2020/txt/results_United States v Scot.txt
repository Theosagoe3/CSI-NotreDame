B. Doctrine of Accession

ship of the enhanced technology under the
common law doctrine of accession. The
parties agree that Maine common law con-
trols. Mathewson Corp. v. Allied Marine
Indus., Inc., 827 F.2d 850, 853 n. 3 (1st
Cir.1987) (appellate court will accept par-
ties’ “expressed preference” and “implicit
concession” as to controlling law, where
“{t}hey have briefed the question in those
terms and the district court ruled on that
basis.”); In re Pioneer Ford Sales, Inc.,
729 F.2d 27, 31 (Ist Cir.1984). Under
Maine law, three factors govern whether
an accession occurs.

[A] chattel is not merged into the realty

unless (1) it is physically annexed, at

least by juxtaposition, to the realty or
some appurtenance thereof, (2) it is
adapted to and usable with that part of

the realty to which it is annexed, and (8)

it was so annexed with the intention, on

the part of the person making the annex-

ation, to make it a permanent accession

to the realty.

claim bears the burden of proof. Hayford
v. Wentworth, 97 Me. 347, 350, 54 A. 940;
Franklin Property Trust, 489 A.2d at 14.

The district court supportably found, on
the basis of testimony it explicitly credited,
that the time taken to remove the “J”
TCM’s and restore the original base tech-
nology was not out of proportion to the
time required for an ordinary upgrade and
therefore that the “J” TCM’s were “readily
removable.” Thus, it was not clear error
to conclude that no physical annexation of
the technology occurred. See, e.g., Peck-
ham v. Continental Cas. Ins. Co., 895

F.2d 830, 840 (Ist Cir.1990) (citing
Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470
US. 564, 573-74, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84
L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)) (no “clear error” where
district court adopts plausible view of evi-
dence). Furthermore, no evidence was prc-
duced at trial that any party involved in the
TCM installation ever anticipated, let alone
that UNUM intended, that the TCM’s
would become accessions to the CSA-owned
computer. The uncontradicted testimony
was to the contrary. Accordingly, the dis-
trict court determination that CSA did not
acquire the “J” TCM’s by accession under
Maine common law must be affirmed.

The district court judgment is aj-
firmed.

United States Court of Appeals,
First Circuit.

Heard July 27, 1992.
Decided Sept. 22, 1992.

Defendant charged with filing false in-
come tax returns moved to suppress evi-
dence of shredded documents found in gar-
bage bags in front of his house. The Unit-
ed States District Court for the District of
Massachusetts, Joseph L. Tauro, Chief
Judge, granted the motion, 776 F.Supp.

Court of Appeals, Torruella, Circuit Judge,
held that warrantless seizure and recon-

violate Fourth Amendment.

1. Searches and Seizures 26

Fourth Amendment did not prohibit
warrantless seizure and reconstruction of
shredded documents found in trash bags
located outside curtilage of defendant’s
house; mere fact that defendant shredded
his garbage before he placed it outside did
not create reasonable heightened expecta-
tion of privacy. U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 4.

2. Searches and Seizures 26

In determining legitimacy of expecta-

would be diminished to compass inconsis-

Judge.

TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.

Constitutionally speaking, we are con-
eerned here with trying to determine
whether there is a difference between so-
called private and public garbage. The
sole issue presented by this appeal is
whether the Fourth Amendment prohibits
the warrantless seizure and reconstruction
of shredded documents found in trash bags
located outside the curtilage of appellee’s
house. Otherwise stated, we must decide
whether the shredding of private docu-
ments attaches a constitutionally recogniz-
able privacy expectancy which follows the
shredded remnants, individually and collec-
tively, even after they become public gar-
bage. Relying on California v. Green-
wood, 486 U.S. 35, 108 S.Ct. 1625, 100

clude that the trial court misinterpreted
Greenwood and reverse its ruling.

I

Appellee was suspected by the Internal
Revenue Service (“IRS”) of involvement in
a scheme to defraud the United States
through the filing of false income tax re-
turns. IRS agents systematically seized
and combed through garbage bags left for
collection in front of appellee’s house.
Their search revealed numerous shredded
documents reduced to 5/32 inch strips,
which when painstakingly pieced together
produced incriminating evidence. The
agents then used this evidence as the basis
for establishing probable cause to request
various search warrants. The search war-
rants were issued and executed, and the
searches garnered additional evidence used
to secure appellee’s 47 count indictment for
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 287. Appellee
moved to suppress the reconstructed docu-
ments as well as the evidence seized pursu-
ant to the search warrants. Appellee ar-
gued that by shredding the documents he
had manifested an objectively reasonable
expectation of privacy in the shredded rem-
nants which was protected by the Fourth
Amendment, a contention that convinced
the district court.

Both parties to this appeal as well as the
district court rely on the same case as
authority for their respective positions,
California v. Greenwood, supra. This
seminal case decided that the Fourth
Amendment does not prohibit the warrant-
less search and seizure of garbage left for
collection outside the curtilage of a home,
except “if respondents [have] manifested a
subjective expectation of privacy in their
garbage that society accepts as objectively
reasonable.” Jd. at 39, 108 S.Ct. at 1628.

Il

[1] We start out with the obvious prop-
osition that what we are dealing with here
is trash. More important is the fact that at
the time the challenged evidence came into
the hands of the authorities, it was public
US. v. SCOTT

Cite as 975 F.2d 927 (1st Cir. 1992)

trash. That is, irrespective of whether ap-
pellee intended to keep secret the contents
of the documents in question by shredding
them, there can be no doubt that appellee
also intended to dispossess himself of those
documents once they were shredded, and to
place their fractured remnants in a public
area accessible to unknown third parties.
The shredded documents were deposited in
a public place and in the control of third
parties, without any limitation as to their
use. Trash collectors and others were at
liberty to dispose of the trash in any man-
ner they saw fit. They were also free to
rummage through the garbage and explore
its contents, whatever that might be. Any
analysis of the expectation of privacy in the
contents of the garbage must take into
consideration these realities. Thus, it is
appropriate to call the evidence at issue
“publie” trash because it was trash left for
collection in a public place and over which
its producer had relinquished possession.

Greenwood recognizes that the search of
trash left for collection in a public place
does not offend societal values. Jd.
Therefore, appellee should have been fore-
warned that he did not have a legitimate
expectation of privacy once his private gar-
bage went into a public place because the
contents of the garbage bags would not be
exempt from public scrutiny. As the Court
stated in Greenwood:

[Having deposited their garbage in an

area particularly suited for public inspec-

tion and, in a manner of speaking, public
consumption, for the express purpose of
having strangers take it, (citation omit-
ted), respondents could have had no rea-
sonable expectation of privacy in the in-
culpatory items that they discarded.
Id. at 40-41, 108 S.Ct. at 1628-29 (emphasis
supplied); see also United States v. Dunn,
480 U.S. 294, 304, 107 S.Ct. 1184, 1141, 94
L.Ed.2d 326 (1987) (erection of ranch type
fences in an open field does not create a
constitutionally protected privacy interest);

Court rejected abandonment as a basis for de-
ciding Greenwood, the above-cited language in

cally refers to discarding inculpatory items,

(placing trash bags within barrels inside
defendant’s lawn not entitled to elevated
“expectation of privacy” respecting the
trash). Other circuits agree with this view
of the Fourth Amendment. See, ¢.g., Unit-
ed States v. Comeaux, 955 F.2d 586, 589
(8th Cir.1992) (warrantless search of ga:
bage within the curtilage of the home per-
missible because the garbage was readily
accessible to the public); United States v.
Hedrick, 922 F.2d 396 (7th Cir.1991) (gaz-
bage within the curtilage of a home may be
searched without a warrant when accessi-
ble to the public).

III

In our view, a person who places trash at
a curb to be disposed of or destroyed by a
third person abandons it! because “{i]m-
plicit in the concept of abandonment is a
renunciation of any reasonable expectation
of privacy in the property abandoned.”
United States v. Mustone, 469 F.2d 970,
972 (ist Cir.1972). The fact that the aban-
doned property was partially destroyed by
shredding, although constituting evidence
of appellee’s subjective desire or hope that
the contents be unintelligible to third par-
ties, does not change the fact that it is as a
result of appellee’s own actions that the
shredded evidence was placed in the public
domain. Had the shredded remnants been
placed in a pile on the curb in front of the
house, or even more doubtfully, had an
errant breeze blown shredded documents
from appellee’s desk into the street into the
open window of a passing police car, the
government would certainly have been free
to seize the incriminatory evidence without
a warrant, and to use its contents without
limitation against appellee. United States
v. Dunn, supra; Oliver v. United States,
466 U.S. 170, 177, 104 S.Ct. 1735, 1740, 80

ment inapplicable); United States v. Fa-
hey, 769 F.2d 829, 8388 (1st Cir.1985) (no
expectation of privacy in open mines).

What we have here is a failed attempt at
secrecy by reason of underestimation of
police resourcefulness, not invasion of con-
stitutionally protected privacy. There is no
constitutional protection from police scruti-
ny as to information received from a failed
attempt at secrecy. See Florida v. Riley,
488 U.S. 445, 449-51, 109 S.Ct. 698, 695-97,
102 L.Ed.2d 835 (1989) (warrantless surveil-
lance by helicopter of partially covered
greenhouse, valid); California v. Ciraolo,
476 U.S. 207, 212-15, 106 S.Ct. 1809, 1812-
19, 90 L.Ed.2d 210 (1986) (warrantless aeri-
al surveillance of yard enclosed by 10 foot
fence, valid); Dow Chemical Co. v. United
States, 476 U.S. 227, 239, 106 S.Ct. 1819,
1827, 90 L.Ed.2d 226 (1986) (taking aerial
photographs of a factory from navigable
airspace, valid).

Appellee here thought that reducing the
documents to 5/82 inch pieces made them
undecipherable. It turned out he was
wrong. He is in no better position than the
citizen who merely tears up a document by
hand and discards the pieces into the side-
walk. Can there be any doubt that the
police are allowed to pick up the pieces
from the sidewalk for use of the contents
against that person? Should the mere use
of more sophisticated “higher” technology
in attempting destruction of the pieces of
paper grant higher constitutional protec-
tion to this failed attempt at secrecy? We
think not. There is no constitutional re-
quirement that police techniques in the de-
tection of crime must remain stagnant
while those intent on keeping their nefari-
ous activities secret have the benefit of
new knowledge. A person who prepares
incriminatory documents in a secret code
{or for that matter in some obscure foreign
language], and thereafter blithely discards
them as trash, relying on the premise or
hope that they will not be deciphered [or
translated] by the authorities could well be
in for an unpleasant surprise if his code is
“broken” by the police [or a translator is
found for the abstruse language], but he
cannot make a valid claim that his subjec-
tive expectation in keeping the contents

975 FEDERAL REPORTER, 2d SERIES

private by use of the secret code [or lan-
guage] was reasonable in a constitutional
sense.

In our view, shredding garbage and plac-
ing it in the public domain subjects it to the
same risks regarding privacy, as engaging
in a private conversation in public where it
is subject to the possibility that it may be
overheard by other persons. Both are
failed attempts at maintaining privacy
whose failure can only be attributed to the
conscious acceptance by the actor of obvi-
ous risk factors. In the case of the conver-
sation, the risk is that conversation in a
public area may be overheard by a third
person. In the disposal of trash, the risk is
that it may be rummaged through and deci-
phered once it leaves the control of the
trasher. In both situations the expectation
of privacy has been practically eliminated
by the citizen’s own action. Law enforce-
ment officials are entitled to apply human
ingenuity and scientific advances to collect
freely available evidence from the public
domain.

The mere fact that appellant shredded
his garbage before he placed it outside of
his home does not create a reasonable
heightened expectation of privacy under
the Fourth Amendment. Appellant still
disearded this garbage in an area particu-
larly suited for public inspection and con-
sumption. At most, appellant’s actions
made it likely that most third parties would
decline to reconstitute the shredded rem-
nants into a legible whole. The Fourth
Amendment, however, does not protect ap-
pellant when a third party expends the
effort and expense to solve the jigsaw puz-
zle created by shredding.

[2] The test for determining legitimacy
of an expectation of privacy “is not wheth-
er the individual chooses to conceal assert-
edly private activity, but instead whether
the government’s intrusion infringes upon
the personal and societal values protected
by the Fourth Amendment.” California v.
Ciraolo, 476 U.S, at 212, 106 S.Ct. at 1812.
The ultimate question in this respect is
“whether, if the particular form of [con-
duct] practiced by the police is permitted to
CHAKOUIAN v. MORAN

931

Cite as 975 F.2d 931 (ist Cir, 1992)

go unregulated by constitutional restraints,
the amount of privacy and freedom remain-
ing to citizens would be diminished to a
compass inconsistent with the aims of a
free and open society.” United States v.
Hendrickson, 940 F.2d 320, 322 (8th Cir.
1991). For the reasons stated, and, we
believe, following the strictures of Green-
wood, such dangers are not found in the
present case.

The decision of the district court is re-
versed and this case is remanded for action
consistent with this opinion.

Reversed and remanded.

United States Court of Appeals,
First: Circuit.

Heard May 5, 1992.
Decided Sept. 28, 1992.

Following affirmance of first-degree
murder conviction, 5387 A.2d 409, state pris-
oner instituted habeas corpus proceedings.
The United States District Court for the
District of Rhode Island, Ronald R. La-
gueux, J., dismissed petition without evi-
dentiary hearing, and defendant appealed.
The Court of Appeals, Cyr, Circuit Judge,
held that: (1) defendant failed to demon-
strate prima facie case of racial discrimina-
tion in prosecution’s use of peremptory
challenges absent any evidence as to
whether other black members of venire
were called and seated as jurors, and (2)
defendant was not entitled to evidentiary
hearing on habeas corpus petition.

Affirmed.

1. Jury €33(5.1)

There is no requirement that prosecu-
tion provide race-neutral explanation for
exercise of peremptory challenges until de-
fendant has made prima facie showing of
racial discrimination.

2. Jury ¢°33(5.1)

To establish prima facie showing of
racia] discrimination in exercise of prosecu-
tion’s peremptory challenges, defendant
must show he is member of cognizable
racial group, and that prosecutor has exer-
cised peremptory challenges to remove
from the venire members of defendant's
race; defendant may rely on the fact that
peremptory challenges constitute practice
that permits those té discriminate who are
of mind to discriminate, and defendant
must show that these facts and any other
relevant cireumstances raise inference that
prosecutor used that practice to exclude
the veniremen from the petit jury on ac-
count of their race.

3. Jury ¢°33(5.1)

To determine whether defendant has
made prima facie showing of racial discrim-
ination in prosecution’s use of peremptory
challenges, all relevant circumstances are
to be considered including patterns of
strikes against black jurors.

4. Habeas Corpus 842

Mixed questions of law and fact aris-
ing under habeas corpus statute are enti-
tled to de novo review. 28. US.C.A.
§ 2254.

5. Jury 120

Defendant’s claim that prosecution's
exercise of peremptory challenges demon-
strated pattern of racial discrimination im-
permissibly depended on pure conjecture
absent any evidence as to whether other
black members of the venire were called
and seated as jurors.
