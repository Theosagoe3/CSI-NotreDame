Vv.

Kallie HAMILTON, Defendant
and Appellant.

No. 02-305.
Supreme Court of Montana.

Submitted on Briefs Oct. 31, 2002.
Decided April 4, 2003.

Defendant was convicted in the District
Court, Gallatin County, Mark Guenther, J.,
of felony criminal possession of dangerous
drugs, and she appealed. The Supreme
Court, Terry N. Trieweiler, J., held that: (1)
defendant had objectively reasonable expec-
tation of privacy in her lost wallet; (2) in a
matter of first impression, police officer’s
warrantless search of coin purse portion of
defendant’s lost wallet exceeded scope of
what was necessary to identify wallet’s own-
er; (3) police detective’s warrantless search of
defendant’s lost wallet, performed after offi-
cer conducted warrantless search of wallet
and discovered powder in coin purse and
informed detective that wallet was “suspi-
cious,” was illegal; and (4) incriminating
statements made by defendant as direct re-
sult of illegal warrantless searches of her lost
wallet had to be suppressed by virtue of
exclusionary rule.

Reversed and remanded.

Standard of review of a district court’s
denial of a motion to suppress evidence is
whether the court’s findings of fact are clear-
ly erroneous and whether those facts were
correctly applied as a matter of law.

2. Searches and Seizures 12

State Constitution provides citizens with
heightened expectation of privacy, beyond
that provided by Federal Constitution.

§§ 10, 11.

3. Searches and Seizures €=26

Whether an individual’s right to privacy
guaranteed by the State Constitution has
been infringed by an unlawful search de-
pends on whether there has been a govern-
ment intrusion into an area subject to a
reasonable expectation of privacy. Const.
Art. 2, § 11.

4, Searches and Seizures 13.1

A “search “occurs when the government
infringes upon an individual’s expectation of
privacy that society considers objectively rea-
sonable. U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 4; Const.

6. Searches and Seizures 26

Inquiry into whether there has been an
unlawful search in violation of the State Con-
stitution is two-fold: (1) Supreme Court looks
at whether the person has an actual expecta-
tion of privacy that society is willing to rec-
ognize as objectively reasonable, and (2) it
looks at the nature of the state’s intrusion.
Const. Art. 2, § 11.

7. Searches and Seizures 29

Defendant had an objectively reasonable
expectation of privacy in her lost wallet, for
purposes of determining whether warrantless
searches of wallet were lawful under State
Constitution; defendant did not intentionally
or knowingly expose her wallet to public, and
her right to exclude others from wallet re-
mained intact. Const. Art. 2, § 11.

is closely tailored to further a compelling
state interest. U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 4;
Const. Art. 2, §§ 10, 11.

9. Searches and Seizures €58

Police officer’s warrantless search of
coin purse portion of defendant’s lost wallet,
which had been turned over to police depart-
ment, exceeded scope of what was necessary
to identify wallet’s owner; defendant testified
that driver’s license was displayed in right
compartment of wallet and checkbook was
displayed in left compartment of wallet, both
of which would have been apparent upon
releasing flap and opening wallet, officer ad-
mitted that it was possible that identification
information in wallet was readily apparent,
and, thus it was clear that there was no need
to search coin purse to determine that defen-
dant owned wallet. Const. Art. 2, § 11.

10. Searches and Seizures 23

A warrantless search is per se unreason-
able unless it falls within one of the narrow
exceptions to the warrant requirement.
U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 4; Const. Art. 2,
§ 11.

11. Searches and Seizures 58

The State has a compelling interest in
safety that justifies an inventory search of
personal property on, or in the possession of,
an arrestee at the police station. Const. Art.
2, §§ 10, 11.

12. Searches and Seizures ¢=58

Identification of the owner is the state’s
paramount objective as the bailee of a lost
wallet; this task requires that the state con-
duct the minimum search necessary to deter-
mine ownership. Const. Art. 2, § 11.

13. Searches and Seizures €=58

With respect to inventory searches, the
least intrusive means possible must be used
to identify the owner of lost property, protect
the contents of personal property for the
owner, and to protect the police from claims
for missing valuables. Const. Art. 2, § 11.

14. Searches and Seizures 58

For purposes of an inventory search of a
lost wallet, the contents of the wallet can be

secured by placing it in an evidence bag and
storing it in a secure place; this method is
also sufficient to protect the police from a
claim for lost or stolen valuables. Const.
Art. 2, § 11.

15. Searches and Seizures 58

State may only conduct a warrantless
search of a lost wallet to determine owner-
ship, and such an identification search must
be conducted pursuant to standardized police
procedure and must reach no further than
necessary to confirm ownership. Const. Art.

16. Searches and Seizures 39

Police detective’s warrantless search of
defendant’s lost wallet, performed after offi-
cer conducted warrantless search of wallet
and discovered powder in coin purse and
informed detective that wallet was “suspi-

to search warrant requirement, and thus was
illegal. Const. Art. 2, § 11.

teenth Judicial District in Gallatin County,
with felony Criminal Possession of Danger-
ous Drugs. Hamilton entered a not guilty
plea and filed a motion to suppress both the
evidence discovered by the Bozeman Police
Department during two warrantless searches
of her lost wallet and the incriminating state-
ments made subsequent to the searches.
Following a hearing, the District Court con-
cluded that an individual’s subjective expec-
tation of privacy in lost or abandoned proper-
ty is not objectively reasonable. Hamilton’s
motion to suppress evidence was denied; she
entered a guilty plea; and, she reserved the
right to appeal the denial of her motion to
suppress. Based on that appeal, we reverse
the order of the District Court.

2 We restate the issues on appeal as
follows:

13 1. Is there an objectively reasonable
expectation of privacy in a lost wallet?

14 2. Did the District Court err when it
denied Hamilton’s motion to suppress evi-
dence obtained during the initial warrantless
search of Hamilton’s wallet?

15 3. Did the District Court err when it
denied Hamilton’s motion to suppress evi-
dence obtained and statements made as the
result of the second warrantless search of
Hamilton’s wallet?

 

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL
BACKGROUND

6 On March 11, 2001, a woman’s wallet
was turned over to the Bozeman Police De-
partment. The officer entrusted with the
wallet completed the requisite paperwork
and gave it to Dennis Thompson, a public
relations employee. Thompson was directed
to find the owner of the wallet and return it.

17 The wallet consisted of two opposing
compartments and a zippered coin purse in
the center. The right compartment featured
a clear plastic window which revealed a driv-
er’s license. The left compartment held a
checkbook, which included the owner’s phone
number and address. The contents of the
zippered coin purse could not be viewed un-
less the coin purse was unzipped. When
folded the wallet was secured by a flap which
concealed its contents.

 

{8 Thompson opened the wallet to deter-
mine the identity of the owner and conducted
an “inventory search” without a warrant.
He testified an “inventory search” of lost
property is routinely conducted to determine
if the property contains valuables. If a wal-
let contains valuables, it is stored in the
evidence room for safekeeping.

19 During the search, Thompson opened
the zipper of the coin purse and an amount
white powder escaped. Further investiga-
tion revealed that the coin purse contained a
substantial amount of the white powder.
Thompson turned the wallet over to the
Drug Task Force and informed Detective
Greg Megargel that the wallet was “suspi-
cious.” No inventory was recorded by
Thompson and he could not recall if he had
determined the identity of the wallet’s owner
before he searched the coin purse and discov-
ered the powder.

110 Detective Megargel conducted a sec-
ond search of the wallet without a warrant
and found a small bag containing crushed red
and white capsules with a white powder resi-
due. Detective Megargel determined that
the white powder was Roxilox, a Schedule II
controlled narcotic. The owner of the wallet,
Kallie Hamilton, was finally contacted using
the identification information found in the
wallet. Hamilton was informed that her wal-
let had been turned over to the police and
that a controlled substance had been found in
the coin purse. Initially, Hamilton claimed
she had a prescription for the Roxilox. La-
ter, she admitted that the drug was not
prescribed for her and that she did not ac-
quire it from a pharmacist.

{11 Hamilton was charged by information
in the Eighteenth Judicial District Court
with Criminal Possession of Dangerous
Drugs, a felony, in violation of § 45-9-102,
MCA (1999). She entered a plea of not
guilty and filed a motion to suppress evi-
dence. Hamilton argued that the drugs dis-
covered in her wallet, and the admissions she
made subsequent to that discovery, were at-
tained in violation of the United States Con-
stitution and the Montana Constitution be-
cause the searches were conducted without a
warrant.
874 Mont.

912 A hearing was held on January 31,
2002. On February 4, 2002, the District
Court concluded that Hamilton had a subjec-
tive expectation of privacy in her lost wallet,
but that her expectation of privacy was not
objectively reasonable. The court held that
no search had occurred within the contempla-
tion of the Fourth Amendment of the United
States Constitution or Article II, Section 11
of the Montana Constitution. Hamilton’s
motion to suppress was denied. Consequent-
ly, she entered a plea of guilty on February
5, 2002, and reserved the right to appeal the
District Court’s Order.

STANDARD OF REVIEW

[1] 113 Our standard of review of a dis-
trict court’s denial of a motion to suppress is
whether the court’s findings of fact are clear-
ly erroneous and whether those facts were
correctly applied as a matter of law. State v.
Williams (1995), 273 Mont. 459, 462, 904 P.2d
1019, 1021.

DISCUSSION

[2] 114 Whether law enforcement is re-
quired to obtain a warrant before searching a
lost wallet is an issue of first impression in
Montana. The Fourth Amendment to the
United States Constitution provides the tra-
ditional protections against unwarranted
searches. However, Montanans have a
heightened expectation of privacy pursuant
to the protections found at Article II, Sec-
tions 10 and 11, of the Montana Constitution.
State v. Scheetz (1997), 286 Mont. 41, 45, 950
P.2d 722, 724.

915 Article II, Section 10, states: “The
right of individual privacy is essential to the
well-being of a free society and shall not be
infringed without the showing of a compel-
ling state interest.”

[38-5] 116 Article II, Section 11, states:

The people shall be secure in their per-
sons, papers, homes and effects from un-
reasonable searches and seizures. No
warrant to search any place, or seize any
person or thing shall issue without describ-
ing the place to be searched or the person
or thing to be seized, or without probable

cause, supported by oath or affirmation
reduced to writing.

4.17 Whether an individual’s right to privacy
guaranteed by the Montana Constitution has
been infringed by an unlawful search de-
pends on whether there has been a govern-
ment intrusion into an area subject to a
reasonable expectation of privacy. Scheetz,
286 Mont. at 46, 950 P.2d at 724. A search
occurs when the government infringes upon
an individual’s expectation of privacy that
society considers objectively reasonable.
Scheetz, 286 Mont. at 46, 950 P.2d at 724
(citing United States v. Jacobsen (1984), 466
US. 109, 1138, 104 S.Ct. 1652, 1656, 80
L.Ed.2d 85, 94). If there is no reasonable
expectation of privacy, “ ‘there is neither a
‘search’ nor a ‘seizure’ within the contempla-
tion of the Fourth Amendment of the United
States Constitution or Article II, Section 11
of the Montana Constitution.’” Scheetz, 286
Mont. at 46, 950 P.2d at 725 (quoting State v.
Bennett (1983), 205 Mont. 117, 121, 666 P.2d
747, 749).

[6] 18 The inquiry into whether there
has been an unlawful search in violation of
the Montana Constitution is two-fold: (1) we
look at whether the person has an actual
expectation of privacy that society is willing
to recognize as objectively reasonable; and
(2) we look at the nature of the state’s intru-
sion. Scheetz, 286 Mont. at 48, 950 P.2d at

726.

ISSUE 1

19 Is there an objectively reasonable ex-
pectation of privacy in a lost wallet?

[7] 120 Hamilton asserts that the Dis-
trict Court was incorrect when it concluded
that she did not have an objectively reason-
able expectation of privacy in her lost wallet.
She contends that she retained a diminished
expectation of privacy in her lost wallet.

{121 The State contends that once an indi-
vidual abandons her property, either inten-
tionally or accidently, the expectation of pri-
vacy recognized by society is nearly non-
existent; and that, consequently, there was
no search of her wallet for constitutional
purposes.
STATE v. HAMILTON

Mont. 875

Cite as 67 P.3d 871 (Mont. 2003)

922 There is no question that Hamilton
had an actual expectation of privacy with
respect to the contents of her lost wallet.
She expected that the person who found her
wallet would look inside for identification, see
her driver’s license or checkbook, and return
the wallet to her without further intrusion.

123 Moreover, there is no question that
society views a person’s expectation of priva-
cy in a wallet or purse as objectively reason-
able. Few things are more inherently pri-
vate than the contents of a wallet or purse.
See State v. Johnston (1982 Wash.), 31 Wash.
App. 889, 645 P.2d 63, 64 (“It would be
difficult to define an object more inherently
private than the contents of a woman’s
purse”); State v. May (1992 Me.), 608 A.2d
772, 774-75 (Defendant’s wallet was held to
be a repository for personal effects inevitably
associated with an expectation of privacy).
We see no meaningful distinction between
the expectation of privacy a person has in the
contents of a purse and the contents of a
wallet. Social security cards, credit cards,
cash, food stamps, phone numbers, pictures
of loved ones, and other personal effects are
often stowed in a wallet to make them readi-
ly available to the owner, yet hidden from the
uninvited eyes of strangers.

124 The question we must answer is
whether society continues to view a person’s
actual expectation of privacy as objectively
reasonable when she loses her wallet.

125 Our analysis begins with the District
Court’s erroneous characterization of Hamil-
ton’s motion to suppress. The District Court
stated that: “The motion to suppress chal-
lenges law enforcement’s warrantless search
of an item of lost or abandoned property.”
It appears that the District Court did not
distinguish an individual’s expectation of pri-
vacy with regard to abandoned property
from an individual’s expectation of privacy
with regard to lost property. However, the
distinction between abandoned and lost prop-
erty is critical to any consideration of wheth-
er there is a reasonable expectation of priva-
cy in the subject wallet.

126 This Court has held that when a per-
son intentionally abandons her property, that
person’s expectation of privacy with regard
to that property is abandoned as well. See

 

State v. Amaya (1987), 227 Mont. 390, 392,
739 P.2d 955, 957. In the case of a lost item,
however, the owner has not intentionally or
voluntarily abandoned his or her property.
It follows that the expectation of privacy one
has in his or her wallet was not voluntarily
surrendered and remains substantially intact.
Courts have recognized that the owner of lost
or mislaid property retains a reasonable ex-
pectation of privacy in that item, diminished
to the extent that the finder may examine
the contents of that item as necessary to
determine the rightful owner.

27 In State v. Ching (1984), 67 Haw. 107,
678 P.2d 1088, the Hawaii Supreme Court
considered whether Ching had an objectively
reasonable expectation of privacy in a small
brass cylinder contained in a pouch that also
held his driver’s license, which was found by
police prior to searching the cylinder. The
prosecution argued that Ching had no rea-
sonable expectation of privacy in the lost
items and, therefore, the search of the brass
cylinder was not constitutionally prohibited.
The court held, however:

Moreover, Ching’s expectation of privacy
in the cylinder was socially reasonable
even though he had misplaced it. ... Prop-
erty is lost through inadvertence, not in-
tent. Although owners of lost property
may expect some intrusion by finders com-
mon sense dictates that they do not forfeit
all expectations of privacy in their proper-
ty as though they had abandoned it.

Ching, 678 P.2d at 1092.

928 In State v. Kealey (1995 Wash.), 80
Wash.App. 162, 907 P.2d 319, the Washington
Supreme Court considered whether Kealey
had a reasonably objective expectation of
privacy in a lost purse that was searched by
police without a warrant. The court held:

[T]he owner of lost or mislaid property,
who is in the eyes of the common law an
inadvertent bailor, retains a reasonable ex-
pectation of privacy in the property ...
This expectation of privacy is diminished,
however, by the fact that the finder/bailee
has an obligation to seek out the owner of
the goods and try to return them. In
other words, the owner’s expectation of
privacy is diminished to the extent that the
876 Mont.

finder may examine and search the lost

property to determine its owner.

Kealey, 907 P.2d at 325-26 (citations omit-
ted).

{129 The above cases stand for the common
sense proposition that the law and society
recognize a difference between a person who
abandons property and a person who loses
property but retains the right and desire to
regain possession of that property. The inte-
gral relationship of one’s intent to the expec-
tation of privacy, is not new to this Court:
“What a person knowingly exposes to the
public is not protected ...’ ‘the reasonable-
ness of [the defendant’s] expectation of priva-
cy turned on the defendant’s right to exclude
others from the premises.’” Scheetz, 286
Mont. at 49, 950 P.2d at 726-27 (citations
omitted).

[8] 130 In this case, Hamilton did not
intentionally or knowingly expose her wallet
to the public and her right to exclude others
from the contents of her wallet remained
intact. The reality that certain people lack
respect for the property of another is no
reason to diminish the expectation of privacy
we protect so jealously in Montana. Pursu-
ant to the Montana Constitution, every per-
son who has a reasonable expectation of pri-
vacy in property maintains that expectation
even though the property has been mis-
placed. That privacy interest may not be
violated by the state unless the intrusion is
closely tailored to further a compelling state
interest.

131 Consequently, we conclude that Ham-
ilton had an objectively reasonable expecta-
tion of privacy in her lost wallet. Her expec-
tation of privacy was diminished only to the
extent necessary for the police to determine
ownership. We conclude that the District
Court erred when it held that Hamilton did
not have an objectively reasonable expecta-
tion of privacy in her lost wallet.

ISSUE 2

132 Did the District Court err when it
denied Hamilton’s motion to suppress evi-

counted as a justification in that case because the

dence obtained during the initial warrantless
search of Hamilton’s wallet?

[9] 133 Hamilton asserts that the search
of her coin purse cannot be justified as an
inventory search because it did not incorpo-
rate the least intrusive means. She contends
that the only justification Thompson had for
searching her wallet without a warrant was
to determine ownership. Hamilton argues
that identification information was readily
apparent in the right and left compartments
of her wallet and that, therefore, Thompson
was not permitted to search the coin purse
without a warrant. The State responds that
the search was an administrative inventory
search similar to the search permitted by
this Court in State v. Pastos.

[10] 34 A warrantless search is per se
unreasonable unless it falls within one of the
narrow exceptions to the warrant require-
ment. Reeves v. State (1979 Alaska), 599 P.2d
727, 735; see Katz v. United States (1967),
389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576.
We have considered the extent to which the
State is permitted to conduct a warrantless
inventory search of an arrestee’s personal
property at the station house and searches
incident to arrest on numerous occasions.
The seemingly inconsistent results reached
by this Court in those decisions reflect the
slight factual variations in each case. Conse-
quently, while those cases provide guidance,
their precedential value is limited by the
factual and circumstantial differences.

35 This Court, however, has established
some fundamental principles of law applica-
ble to searches and seizures of property for
inventory purposes. In State v. Sawyer
(1977), 174 Mont. 512, 571 P.2d 1131 (over-
ruled on other grounds by State v. Long
(1985), 216 Mont. 65, 67, 700 P.2d 153, 155),
we recognized two justifications for an inven-
tory search of an impounded vehicle: (1)
protection of the contents of the vehicle for
the owner’s benefit; and (2) protection of the
police from claims for lost property in their
custody. Sawyer, 174 Mont. at 517, 571 P.2d
at 1134.1 Although we recognized those con-

arrestee was available for consultation.
STATE v. HAMILTON

Mont. 877

Cite as 67 P.3d 871 (Mont. 2003)

cerns as legitimate, we held that a general
search of the defendant’s property was nei-
ther justified nor necessary “under the coun-
tervailing force of the right of the individual
to privacy and freedom from unreasonable
searches in Montana.” Sawyer, 174 Mont. at
518, 571 P.2d at 1134. We concluded that
the police could protect themselves from lia-
bility for lost or stolen property by taking an
inventory of the items in plain view, locking
the vehicle, and returning the keys to the
owner. Sawyer, 174 Mont. at 518, 571 P.2d at
1134. Importantly, Sawyer required the
State to use the least intrusive means to
protect itself from a claim for lost or stolen
contents found in an impounded automobile.

136 Eight years later, in State v. Sierra
(1985), 214 Mont. 472, 478, 692 P.2d 1273,
1277 (overruled on other grounds by State v.
Pastos (1994), 269 Mont. 48, 57, 887 P.2d 199,
208), we concluded that the broader privacy
protections of the Montana Constitution re-
quired that the State incorporate the least
intrusive means possible when it conducted
an inventory search of a briefcase that be-
longed to a person in police custody. This
Court rejected Illinois v. Lafayette (1983),
462 U.S. 640, 103 S.Ct. 2605, 77 L.Ed.2d 65, a
case in which the United States Supreme
Court held that the State’s interest in an
inventory search conducted to preserve prop-
erty, protect the police from claims for lost
property, identify the owner, and protect the
police from hazards presented by uninvento-
ried packages outweighed the defendant’s
privacy interest. Sierra, 214 Mont. at 475-
76, 692 P.2d at 1275-276.

[11] 137 In State v. Pastos (1994), 269
Mont. 43, 47, 887 P.2d 199, 202, this Court
confirmed that the right to privacy may only
be infringed by a compelling state interest
and a procedure closely tailored to effectuate
that interest. We held that:

[T]he State has a legitimate and compel-
ling interest in protecting, to the extent
possible, the safety of the arrestee and
other persons in and about the station
house from weapons, dangerous instru-
mentalities, and hazardous substances
which might be concealed on or in the
personal property and possessions of the
arrestee.

Pastos, 269 Mont. at 51, 887 P.2d at 204.
Pastos stands for the proposition that the
State has a compelling interest in safety that
justifies an inventory search of personal
property on, or in the possession of, an arres-
tee at the police station. The arrestee’s im-
mediate possession of the property was a
determinative factor in that case. Pastos,
269 Mont. at 57, 887 P.2d at 208. We over-
ruled our holding in Sierra to the extent that
it required the State to use the least restric-
ive means possible when an inventory
search is conducted for safety reasons. Pas-
tos, 269 Mont. at 57, 887 P.2d at 208. Inven-
ory searches conducted to protect valuables
of the arrestee and to protect the police from
lost or stolen property claims were only dis-
cussed in dicta.

138 The compelling interest asserted in
Pastos was the need for police to ensure that
he property an arrestee possessed when he
was arrested did not pose a threat to those
he would come into contact with at the sta-
ion. Nothing in Pastos permits the police to
conduct a general search of property held in
police custody when the asserted justification
relates only to protecting the property for
he owner and protecting the police from a
claim for lost or stolen property.

139 We conclude that the danger posed by
property possessed by an arrestee, as was
he case in Pastos, is not present here there
was no risk that Hamilton would pull a weap-
on out of her lost wallet. The Constitution
does not allow a general search of a benign
object based on such a remote possibility of
harm as is suggested by the State in this
case. Absent an objectively reasonable belief
hat the wallet posed some real threat to
safety, the State’s claim that there was a
compelling safety interest which justified a
general search of the wallet for weapons,
explosives or hazardous materials is implau-
sible. See Ching, 678 P.2d at 1093.

1.40 Three additional interests have been
asserted by the State: (1) the need to deter-
mine the owner’s identity; (2) the need to
protect any valuables; and (3) the need to
protect the police from a claim that the con-
tents of the wallet were lost or stolen while
in police custody. In both Sawyer and Sier-
ra, the inventory search was conducted while
878 Mont.

e owner of the property was in police cus-
ody. Consequently, we concluded the need
0 identify the owner and the need to protect
e property for the owner did not justify an
inventory search in either case. However,
the fundamental requirement that the State
use the least intrusive method to protect
itself from a claim for lost or stolen property
as discussed in those cases is applicable to
the current case.

141 In Reeves v. State, the Alaska Su-
preme Court considered the extent to which
the state was permitted to conduct an inven-
tory search for the dual purpose of protect-
ing property for an arrestee and protecting
itself from claims for lost or stolen property.
The court reviewed the search pursuant to
the heightened expectation of privacy provid-
ed for by the Alaska Constitution. The Alas-
ka court stated:

An arrestee’s property can be sufficiently
protected simply by placing it in a ‘proper-
ty bag’ ... However benevolent the state’s
intentions in this regard, [the protection of
valuables] cannot serve as a justification
for a general search of the arrestee’s pos-
sessions.

[T]he state, as an involuntary bailee, has
‘only a ‘slight’ duty of care’ with respect to
property in its possession ... and this
‘duty could easily be met without extensive
inventory.’ The state can effectively insu-
late itself against fraudulent claims by sim-
ply listing by description any items of
property taken from an arrestee; securing
those items in a property bag or other
secure storage container used in the facili-
ty, preferably in the arrestee’s presence

FN 28. The government’s interest in
protecting itself against fraudulent post-
incarceration claims of loss or damage to
property is at best a tenuous reason for
infringing the privacy of an individual’s
belongings. Consequently, an inventory
search should be rigidly circumscribed in
scope, perhaps more so than any other
type of justified warrantless search.
Reeves, 599 P.2d at 736-87 (citations omit-
ted).

67 PACIFIC REPORTER, 3d SERIES

{42 A post-arrest inventory and the inven-
tory search of a lost wallet occur under dif-
ferent circumstances. The search of a lost
item should be by the least intrusive means
necessary to identify its owner and secure
the property. The method of securing prop-
erty in Reeves is consistent with the least
intrusive means discussed by this Court in
Sawyer and Sierra.

1.43 As a gratuitous bailee, the police are
charged with a slight duty of care which is
violated only by gross negligence. Sawyer,
174 Mont. at 517, 571 P.2d at 1134. Common
sense suggests the risk that valuables would
be misplaced or stolen increase with the fre-
quency and intensity with which the valu-
ables are handled and examined. The cited
cases provide a convincing argument that no
search is required to secure the contents of a
lost wallet and protect the police from a
claim for lost or stolen valuables. The least
intrusive manner to secure the contents of a
lost wallet, which is also the most effective
manner, is to place the wallet in an evidence
bag and store it in a secure place until it is
claimed by its rightful owner.

[12] 144 Next, we must determine to
what extent the police are permitted to con-
duct a search to identify the owner. Identifi-
cation of the owner is the State’s paramount
objective as the bailee of a lost wallet. See
Ching, 678 P.2d at 1092-93. This task re-
quires that the State conduct the minimum
search necessary to determine ownership.

45 The courts in Ching and Kealey held
that the government was permitted to con-
duct a warrantless search of lost property to
the extent necessary to determine ownership.
Hamilton agrees that the police were permit-
ted to look inside her wallet for identification
so it could be returned. However, she con-
tends that when Thompson opened her coin
purse, he went beyond the scope of what was
necessary to determine ownership.

[13-15] 46 We conclude that the least
intrusive means possible must be used to
identify the owner of lost property, protect
the contents of personal property for the
owner, and to protect the police from claims
for missing valuables. The contents of a lost
STATE v. HAMILTON

wallet can be secured by placing the wallet in
an evidence bag and storing it in a secure
place. This method is also sufficient to pro-
tect the police from a claim for lost or stolen
valuables. Consequently, the State may only
conduct a warrantless search of a lost wallet
to determine ownership. Furthermore, an
identification search must be conducted pur-
suant to standardized police procedure and
must reach no further than necessary to
confirm ownership.

147 We conclude that Thompson’s search
exceeded what was necessary to identify the
wallet’s owner. Hamilton testified that a
driver’s license was displayed in the right
compartment and a checkbook was displayed
in the left compartment of her wallet both of
which would have been apparent upon releas-
ing the flap and opening the wallet. While
Thompson could not recall if he saw the
checkbook or driver’s license before he con-
ducted his search, he admitted it was possi-
ble that the identification information was
readily apparent. Finally, when Detective
Megargel took custody of the wallet, he
found a driver’s license, a social security
card, and a checkbook that all indicated Kal-
lie Hamilton owned the lost wallet. It is clear
that there was no need to search the coin
purse to determine that Hamilton owned the
lost wallet in light of the above facts.

48 Therefore, we conclude that the evi-
dence discovered as the result of the search
conducted by Thompson must be suppressed.

ISSUE 3

949 Did the District Court err when it
denied Hamilton’s motion to suppress evi-
dence obtained and statements made as the
result of the second warrantless search of
Hamilton’s wallet?

[16,17] 150 The subsequent search,
which was conducted by Detective Megargel
of the Drug Task Force, was performed after
Thompson discovered the powder in the coin
purse and informed Detective Megargel that
the wallet was “suspicious.” This search was
neither an identification search, nor was it an
inventory search. It was an investigative
search conducted to determine whether or
not the suspicious nature of the wallet was

evidence of criminal activity. Therefore, De-
tective Megargel was required to obtain a
search warrant absent an exception to the
warrant requirement.

151 The State does not argue that the
search was conducted pursuant to an excep-
tion to the warrant requirement. Instead
the State cites State v. Copridge (1996), 260
Kan. 19, 918 P.2d 1247, 1251, and contends
that Detective Megargel was permitted to
take a “second look” at the wallet. The court
in Copridge held that no warrant was re-
quired to conduct a post-arrest search of
clothing lawfully seized by police because the
arrestee had no expectation of privacy. Co-
pridge interprets Kansas and Federal law on
an entirely different issue than the one
raised by the warrantless search of Hamil-
ton’s wallet and is irrelevant.

52 Our review of the record indicates
that the search was not justified by any other
exception to the warrant requirement.
Therefore, the warrantless search conducted
by Detective Megargel was illegal and violat-
ed Hamilton’s expectation of privacy. Con-
sequently, Detective Megargel’s discovery of
the powder and determination that it was a
controlled substance must be suppressed.
We conclude that the District Court erred
when it denied Hamilton’s motion to sup-
press the evidence discovered during Detec-
tive Megargel’s warrantless search.

[18] 53 The white powder discovered by
Thompson, and the illegal nature of the white
powder confirmed by Detective Megargel,
were both the results of unconstitutional
searches. Hamilton contends that the in-
criminating statements she made subsequen'
to the illegal searches are “fruits of the poi-
sonous tree” that should be suppressed as
well. It is well established that an incrimina-
ting statement made as the direct result oi
an illegal search is inadmissible by virtue o:
the exclusionary rule. State v. Bassett, 1999
MT 109, 157, 294 Mont. 327, 157, 982 P.2
410, 157. We conclude that the statements
made by Hamilton following the illegal
search conducted by Detective Megarge
must be suppressed.

the Order of the District Court is reversed,
and we remand this case to the Distric
880 Mont.

Court for further proceedings consistent with
this Opinion.

155 I concur in our Opinion and have,
accordingly, signed the same.

956 It is also worth noting that even
Montana’s statutory law does not justify the
sort of intrusive search that was conducted in
this case. This State’s law on bailments
provides that an “involuntary deposit” or
bailment occurs when, among other things, a
person accidentally leaves or places personal
property in the possession of any person,
without negligence on the part of the owner.
Sections 70-6-101(1), MCA and 70-6-103(1),
MCA. The person with whom a thing is
involuntarily deposited is then bound to take
charge of it if able to do so. Section 70-6-
104, MCA. Certainly, when one accidentally
loses his or her wallet or purse and it comes
into the possession of the police or some
other third party, an involuntary bailment
occurs and the police or third party become
depositaries.

9157 Section 170-6-201,
that:

A depositary may not use the thing depos-

ited or permit it to be used for any pur-

pose without the consent of the depositor.

He may not, if it is purposely fastened by

the depositor, open it without the consent

of the latter, except in case of necessity.

[Emphasis added].

Again, while necessity may dictate that the
depositary open a fastened wallet or purse to
the extent required to conduct a minimally
intrusive search for the owner's identity,
once that purpose is fulfilled, the depositary
is prohibited under this statute from opening
other fastened compartments and containers
in the wallet or purse absent the consent of
the owner.

158 In the case at bar, the police, as
involuntary depositaries, were within their
authority to unfasten Hamilton’s wallet to
learn her identity. However, once that was

In reviewing sufficiency of the evidence,
an appellate court examines whether, after
viewing the evidence in a light most favor-
able to the prosecution, any rational trier of
fact could have found the essential elements
of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.
