UNITED STATES of America,
Plaintiff—Appellee,

v.

Joshua BURGARD, Defendant-—
Appellant.

No. 11-1863.

United States Court of Appeals,
Seventh Circuit.

Argued Sept. 14, 2011.

Decided April 2, 2012.
Background: Following denial of his mo-
tion to suppress, 2011 WL 353520, defen-
dant was convicted in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of
Tllinois, David R. Herndon, Chief District
Judge, on a plea of guilty to two counts of
receiving child pornography and was sen-
tenced to 210 months’ imprisonment and
15 years of supervised release. Defendant
appealed.

Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Wood,

Circuit Judge, held that:

(1) six-day delay between the warrantless
seizure of defendant’s cell phone and
the time police secured a search war-
rant did not render the seizure unrea-
sonable, but

(2) when an officer waits an unreasonably
long time to obtain a search warrant,
in violation of the Fourth Amendment,
the good-faith exception to the sup-
pression rule is not automatically avail-
able as soon as a warrant materializes.

Affirmed.

1. Searches and Seizures ¢=24, 57

In general, seizures of personal prop-
erty are unreasonable within the meaning
of the Fourth Amendment unless accom-
plished pursuant to a judicial warrant, but
an officer may temporarily seize property
without a warrant if she has probable
cause to believe that a container holds
contraband or evidence of a crime and the

exigencies of the circumstances demand it
or some other recognized exception to the
warrant requirement is present. U.S.C.A.
Const.Amend. 4.

2. Searches and Seizures 24, 53.1

Even a permissible warrantless sei-
zure must comply with the Fourth Amend-
ment’s reasonableness requirement, and
thus, after seizing an item, police must
obtain a search warrant within a reason-
able period of time. U.S.C.A. Const.
Amend. 4.

3. Searches and Seizures 53.1

When officers fail to seek a search
warrant following a permissible warrant-
less seizure, at some point the delay be-
comes unreasonable and is actionable un-
der the Fourth Amendment. U.S.C.A.
Const.Amend. 4.

4. Searches and Seizures <25.1, 26, 53.1

For purposes of determining the rea-
sonableness of a delay in seeking a search
warrant following a permissible warrant-
less seizure, the critical question on the
individual person’s side of the balance
elates to any possessory interest in the
seized object, not to privacy or liberty
interests; a seizure affects only the per-
son’s possessory interests, while a search
affects a person’s privacy interests, and
the longer the police take to seek a war-
rant, the greater the infringement on the
person’s possessory interest will be.
U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 4.

5. Searches and Seizures 40.1, 53.1
For purposes of determining the rea-
sonableness of a delay in seeking a search
warrant following a permissible warrant-
less seizure, a key factor on the state’s side
of the balance is the strength of the state’s
basis for the seizure; the state has a
stronger interest in seizures made on the
basis of probable cause than in those rest-
ing only on reasonable suspicion, and all
1030

else being equal, the Fourth Amendment
will tolerate greater delays after probable-
cause seizures. U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 4.

6. Searches and Seizures 53.1, 57

For purposes of determining the rea-
sonableness of a delay in seeking a search
warrant following a permissible warrant-
less seizure, the court must take into ac-
count whether the police diligently pur-
sued their investigation; when police act
with diligence, courts can have greater
confidence that the police interest is legiti-
mate and that the intrusion is no greater
than reasonably necessary, but when po-
lice neglect to seek a warrant without any
good explanation for that delay, it appears
that the state is indifferent to searching
the item and the intrusion on an individu-
al’s possessory interest is less likely to be
justifiable. U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 4.

7. Obscenity 7.6

Six-day delay between the warrantless
seizure of child pornography defendant’s
cell phone and the time police secured a
search warrant to look for images on the
phone did not render the seizure unreason-
able for purposes of the Fourth Amend-
ment, even if the officer preparing the
warrant affidavit did fail to act diligently;
while the officer may have been able to
work more quickly, his delay was not the
result of complete abdication of his work
or failure to see any urgency, but rather,
he wanted to be sure that he had all the
information he needed from the seizing
officer and wanted to consult with the
prosecutor, all the while attending to his
other law enforcement duties. U.S.C.A.
Const.Amend. 4.

8. Criminal Law ¢=392.38(7)

When an officer waits an unreason-
ably long time to obtain a search warrant,
in violation of the Fourth Amendment, the
good-faith exception to the suppression
rule is not automatically available as soon
as a warrant materializes; a well-trained

675 FEDERAL REPORTER, 3d SERIES

officer is presumed to be aware that a
seizure must last no longer than reason-
ably necessary for the police, acting with
diligence, to obtain a warrant, and when
police fail to act with such diligence, exclu-
sion will typically be the appropriate reme-
dy. U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 4.

Before WOOD, TINDER, and
HAMILTON, Circuit Judges.

WOOD, Circuit Judge.

Expecting to find evidence of child por-
nography, police officers seized Joshua
Burgard’s cell phone without a warrant.
At that point, however, they seemed to
have lost their sense of urgency: they did
nothing with the phone right away and
allowed six days to elapse before they
applied for a search warrant. Once they
had the warrant in hand, they searched
the phone and, as anticipated, they found
sexually explicit images of underage girls.
Burgard pleaded guilty to two counts of
receiving child pornography in violation of
18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(2), and was sentenced
to 210 months’ imprisonment and 15 years
of supervised release.

On appeal Burgard challenges only the
district court’s denial of his motion to sup-
press the photographs found on the phone.
The pictures should have been excluded, in
his view, because the police tarried too
long before obtaining the warrant. Al-
though we agree with Burgard that the
officers did not act with perfect diligence,
US. v. BURGARD

1031

we do not find the delay here to be so
egregious that it renders the search and
seizure unreasonable under the Fourth
Amendment. We therefore affirm.

I

On Wednesday, January 6, 2010, a
friend of Burgard approached Sergeant
Louis Wilson of the Smithton, Illinois, Po-
lice Department. The friend told Wilson
that he had seen sexual images of young
girls (possibly aged 14 or younger) on Bur-
gard’s cell phone, and that Burgard, 21
years old at the time, had bragged about
having sex with them. This friend agreed
to serve as a confidential informant and to
text Wilson later that night if he was with
Burgard and Burgard had the phone. The
informant followed through with the plan:
that night, he texted Wilson that he and
Burgard were driving together in the in-
formant’s car. Wilson then stopped the
informant’s car and seized Burgard’s
phone. Burgard voluntarily went to the
police station where Wilson entered the
phone into evidence and gave Burgard a
property receipt.

Wilson did not immediately apply for a
state search warrant. Instead, he wrote a
report about the seizure and forwarded it
to Detective Mark Krug in nearby Collins-
ville, because Krug was assigned to work
part-time with the FBI’s Cyber Crimes
Task Force. Wilson and Krug worked
different shifts, however, and so Krug did
not receive Wilson’s report until the next
day. After Krug read the report, he tried
to contact Wilson to learn more details, but
again the shift differences got in the way
and the two were unable to speak until
later that night. The next day, Friday,
January 8, Krug contacted the United
States Attorney's Office to inform it that
he planned to draft a federal search war-
rant for the phone. An Assistant United
States Attorney (AUSA) told him to pro-
ceed with drafting the affidavit.

Some time that same day, an armed
robbery occurred in Collinsville. Because
the armed robbery was more pressing,
Krug put the cell phone warrant aside and
worked on the armed robbery investiga-
tion. (We note at this juncture that Col-
linsville was, as of the time of the 2010
Census, a town of 26,016; it is located in
rural Madison County, Illinois, and is the
self-proclaimed Horseradish Capital of the
World. See The Global Gourmet, http://
www.globalgourmet.com/food/egg/egg1296/
horscap.html# axzzlp7ZbAOQ2x, last visit-
ed March 28, 2012.) Krug may have con-
tinued to work on the robbery on Satur-
day, or he may have taken that day off.
But by Sunday, he was able to return to
Burgard’s case and draft the affidavit. On
Monday morning, January 11, he sent his
draft to the AUSA and the two went back
and forth making edits. The next day, the
AUSA finally presented a completed war-
rant application to the federal magistrate
judge, who signed the warrant that day.
Krug promptly searched the phone pursu-
ant to the warrant and found numerous
sexually explicit images of young girls.

Burgard conceded that the initial war-
rantless seizure of the phone was lawful
(because of exigency and probable cause),
but he sought to suppress the images on
the basis of the six-day delay. The district
court denied his motion to suppress on two
grounds: (1) it did not find the delay to be
unreasonable, and (2) even if it were, the
good-faith exception to the exclusionary
rule applied. Burgard pleaded guilty but
reserved his right to challenge the denial
of the suppression motion.

II

[1] This case requires us to address
one narrow question: did the six-day delay
in securing a warrant render the seizure of
Burgard’s phone unreasonable for pur-
poses of the Fourth Amendment? (All
1032

parties agree that the warrant was neces-
sary, and so we make no comment on that
point. The search here was of the more
invasive type excluded from our discussion
in United States v. Flores—Lopez, 670 F.3d
803, 810 (7th Cir.2012).) In general, “sei-
zures of personal property are ‘unreason-
able within the meaning of the Fourth
Amendment ... unless ... accomplished
pursuant to a judicial warrant.’” Illinois
v. McArthur, 531 U.S. 326, 330, 121 S.Ct.
946, 148 L.Ed.2d 838 (2001) (quoting Unit-
ed States v. Place, 462 U.S. 696, 701, 103
S.Ct. 2637, 77 L.Ed.2d 110 (1983)). An
officer may temporarily seize property
without a warrant, however, if she has
“probable cause to believe that a container
holds contraband or evidence of a crime”
and “the exigencies of the circumstances
demand it or some other recognized excep-
tion to the warrant requirement is pres-
ent.” Place, 462 U.S. at 701, 103 S.Ct.
2637.

[2] Even a permissible warrantless sei-
zure, such as the initial seizure here, must
comply with the Fourth Amendment’s rea-
sonableness requirement. Thus, the Su-
preme Court has held that after seizing an
item, police must obtain a search warrant
within a reasonable period of time. See,
eg. Segura v. United States, 468 U.S. 796,
812, 104 S.Ct. 3380, 82 L.Ed.2d 599 (1984)
(“{A] seizure reasonable at its inception
because based on probable cause may be-
come unreasonable as a result of its dura-
tion.”). We reject the notion that anything
in this court’s opinion in Lee v. City of
Chicago, 330 F.3d 456 (7th Cir.2003), un-
dermined Segura’s holding. In Lee we
held that an individual cannot challenge
the police’s continued retention of his vehi-
cle for failure to pay impound fees on
Fourth Amendment grounds; he could
only challenge the initial seizure. See 330
F.3d at 465-66. Here, in contrast, the
police needed within a reasonable time to
obtain a warrant before they could under-
take a new search and seizure—that of the

675 FEDERAL REPORTER, 3d SERIES

contents of the cell phone. This is the
essence of Burgard’s complaint, not the
retention point that was central to Lee.
See United States v. Martin, 157 F.3d 46,
54 (2d Cir.1998) (“[W]here officers have
probable cause to believe container con-
tains contraband, it ‘may be seized, at least
temporarily, without a warrant.’”) (quot-
ing in parenthetical United States v. Ja-
cobsen, 466 U.S. 109, 121, 104 S.Ct. 1652,
80 L.Ed.2d 85 (1984)). No other recog-
nized exception to the warrant require-
ment covered the police detention of the
contents of Burgard’s phone.

[3] When officers fail to seek a search
warrant, at some point the delay becomes
unreasonable and is actionable under the
Fourth Amendment. Moya v. United
States, 761 F.2d 322, 325 n. 1 (7th Cir.
1984) (“Even if the officers had probable
cause to believe Moya’s bag contained con-
traband, there would be a question wheth-
er the three hour detention of the bag
before seeking a search warrant was rea-
sonable.”). See generally Phillip B. Grif-
fith, Thinking Outside of the ‘Detained’
Bow: A Guide to Temporary Seizures of
Property Under the Fourth Amendment,
Army Lawyer, Dec. 2009, at 11, 13 (“Once
government agents establish probable
cause, this accordingly triggers the obli-
gation to diligently pursue an authorization
to search the property.”). We review the
district court’s decision about the reason-
ableness of the delay prior to the issuance
of the warrant de novo, see United States
v. Richmond, 641 F.3d 260, 261-62 (7th
Cir.2011). The government does not ar-
gue that the magistrate judge was told
about the length of the delay, and so we
have not been asked to give special defer-
ence to any finding relating to its reason-
ableness (or lack thereof). See United
States v. McIntire, 516 F.3d 576, 578 (7th
Cir.2008).

A

There is unfortunately no bright line
past which a delay becomes unreasonable.
Instead, the Supreme Court has dictated
that courts must assess the reasonableness
of a seizure by weighing “the nature and
quality of the intrusion on the individual’s
Fourth Amendment interests against the
importance of the governmental interests
alleged to justify the intrusion.” Place,
462 U.S. at 703, 103 S.Ct. 2637; see also
McArthur, 531 U.S. at 331, 121 S.Ct. 946
(instructing courts to “balance the privacy-
related and law enforcement-related con-
cerns to determine if the intrusion was
reasonable”).

[4] On the individual person’s side of
this balance, the critical question relates to
any possessory interest in the seized ob-
ject, not to privacy or liberty interests. “A
seizure affects only the person’s possesso-
ry interests; a search affects a person’s
privacy interests.” Segura, 468 U.S. at
806, 104 S.Ct. 3380. The longer the police
take to seek a warrant, the greater the
infringement on the person’s possessory
interest will be, for the obvious reason that
a longer seizure is a greater infringement
on possession than a shorter one. But
unnecessary delays also undermine the
criminal justice process in a more general
way: they prevent the judiciary from
promptly evaluating and correcting im-
proper seizures. Thus the “brevity” of the
seizure is “an important factor” for us to
weigh. Place, 462 U.S. at 709, 103 S.Ct.
2637. In addition, it can be revealing to
see whether the person from whom the
item was taken ever asserted a possessory
claim to it—perhaps by checking on the
status of the seizure or looking for assur-
ances that the item would be returned. If
so, this would be some evidence (helpful,
though not essential) that the seizure in
fact affected her possessory interests.
See, e.g., United States v. Stabile, 633 F.3d
219, 235-36 (8d Cir.2011) (defendant's fail-

ure to seek return of his property for more
than 18 months was a factor that reduced
the weight the court gave to his interest in
the item).

[5] Turning to the state’s side, a key
factor in our analysis is the strength of the
state’s basis for the seizure. The state has
a stronger interest in seizures made on the
basis of probable cause than in those rest-
ing only on reasonable suspicion. All else
being equal, the Fourth Amendment will
tolerate greater delays after probable-
cause seizures. Compare McArthur, 531
US. at 331, 121 S.Ct. 946 (two-hour delay
after probable-cause seizure of house was
reasonable), with Place 462 U.S. at 709,
103 S.Ct. 2637 (90-minute delay after rea-
sonable-suspicion seizure of suitcase was
unreasonable); see also United States v.
Martin, 157 F.3d 46 (2d Cir.1998) (11-day
delay after probable cause seizure of pack-
age was reasonable).

[6] Finally, when we balance these
competing interests we must “take into
account whether the police diligently pur-
sue[d] their investigation.” Place, 462
US. at 709, 103 S.Ct. 2637. When police
act with diligence, courts can have greater
confidence that the police interest is legiti-
mate and that the intrusion is no greater
than reasonably necessary. McArthur,
531 U.S. at 331, 121 S.Ct. 946 (upholding
two-hour delay because it was “no longer
than reasonably necessary for the police,
acting with diligence, to obtain the war-
rant”). When police neglect to seek a
warrant without any good explanation for
that delay, it appears that the state is
indifferent to searching the item and the
intrusion on an individual’s possessory in-
terest is less likely to be justifiable. Com-
pare United States v. Mitchell, 565 F.3d
1347, 1351 (11th Cir.2009) (21-day delay
was unreasonable where “[t]he only reason
Agent West gave for the twenty-one-day
delay in applying for a search warrant was
1034

that he ‘didn’t see any urgency’”), with
United States v. Vallimont, 378 Fed.Appx.
972, 976 (11th Cir.2010) (45-day delay rea-
sonable where officers’ attention was di-
verted to other matters but officers contin-
ued to work on the search warrant).

B

[7] Applying these factors, we cannot
say that the six-day delay here was so long
that the seizure was unreasonable. We
acknowledge that Burgard had a strong
interest in possessing his cell phone. At
no point before the seizure did he abandon
the phone or relinquish it to a third party.
He even asserted his possessory interests
over the phone by voluntarily going to the
police station to obtain a property receipt,
which would help him obtain the phone’s
return.

On the other side of the equation, law
enforcement’s interests were also strong.
Burgard has conceded that police had
probable cause to believe that the phone
would contain evidence of a crime. Al-
though the Supreme Court found a 90-
minute delay to be unreasonable in Place,
462 U.S. at 696, 103 S.Ct. 2637, the Court
said nothing to suggest that 90 minutes is
an outer limit for all cases. For one thing,
the seizure in Place was made on the basis
of reasonable suspicion, not probable
cause. See Martin, 157 F.3d at 54. And
even in a reasonable suspicion case, 90
minutes would not necessarily be the outer
limit, as the length of a delay is not the
only relevant factor. See United States v.
Ganser, 315 F.3d 839, 844 (7th Cir.2003)
(four-day delay following reasonable suspi-
cion seizure was not unreasonable).

Given these facts, Burgard leans heavily
on the diligence factor, arguing that the
officer was not diligent because he should
have been able to submit the warrant ap-
plication more quickly. We are willing to
assume that Burgard is correct on this
point. It strikes us as implausible that an

675 FEDERAL REPORTER, 3d SERIES

officer with over 14 years of experience,
like Krug, could not write a two-page affi-
davit in fewer than six days, especially
when the affidavit drew largely on infor-
mation that was contained in the initial
report that he received from Wilson. The
government argues that the delay was at-
tributable to Krug’s lack of familiarity with
federal cell-phone warrants, but that ex-
planation is not persuasive given the fact
that the bulk of the warrant appears to be
boilerplate. And although it is true that
the detective’s attention was diverted by a
more serious robbery case, this did not
take place until Friday, after three days
had already passed.

But police imperfection is not enough to
warrant reversal. With the benefit of
hindsight, courts “can almost always imag-
ine some alternative means by which the
objectives of the police might have been
accomplished,” but that does not necessari-
ly mean that the police conduct was unrea-
sonable. United States v. Sharpe, 470
U.S. 675, 686-87, 105 S.Ct. 1568, 84
L.Ed.2d 605 (1985). Krug may theoreti-
cally have been able to work more quickly,
but his delay was not the result of com-
plete abdication of his work or failure to
“see any urgency” as in Mitchell, 565 F.3d
at 1351. He wanted to be sure that he had
all the information he needed from the
seizing officer and he wanted to consult
with the AUSA, all the while attending to
his other law enforcement duties. We do
not want to discourage this sort of careful,
attentive police work, even if it appears to
us that it could or should have moved more
quickly. Encouraging slapdash work
could lead to a variety of other problems.
See, eg., Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U.S. 551,
124 S.Ct. 1284, 157 L.Ed.2d 1068 (2004)
(warrant failed to meet Fourth Amend-
ment’s particularity requirement, because
of failure in copying paragraph from war-
rant application to warrant).
US. v. BURGARD

1035

Cite as 675 F.3d 1029 (7th Cir. 2012)

After seizing an item without a warrant,
an officer must make it a priority to secure
a search warrant that complies with the
Fourth Amendment. This will entail dili-
gent work to present a warrant application
to the judicial officer at the earliest rea-
sonable time. We find that this standard
was met here and that the six-day delay
was not so unreasonable as to violate the
Constitution. Burgard argues that this
outcome could “give authorities license to
retain seized property for long periods of
time merely because they chose not to
devote a reasonable amount of resources
and sufficient experienced personnel” to
the task of obtaining warrants. Given the
fact-specific nature of these inquiries, we
think these fears are overblown. It re-
mains possible that a police department’s
failure to staff its offices adequately or to
give officers sufficient resources to process
warrant applications could lead to unrea-
sonable delays. But this case does not
present that sort of egregious abdication of
duties.

Ill

[8] The district court reached the same
conclusion as we do on the merits of the
Fourth Amendment, but it then went on to
address the government’s alternative argu-
ment that the good-faith exception to the
exclusionary rule should apply. The court
concluded that even if the delay was un-
reasonably long, suppression would be in-
appropriate because the officers searched
the phone in reliance on a warrant, and it
thought that this triggered the good-faith
exception of United States v. Leon, 468
US. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677
(1984). This analysis, we believe, extended
Leon too far.

When an officer waits an unreasonably
long time to obtain a search warrant, in
violation of the Fourth Amendment, he
cannot seek to have evidence admitted
simply by pointing to that late-obtained
warrant. If this were all that was need-

ed, evidence would never be suppressed
following these types of violations be-
cause, by definition, the police would al-
ways have a warrant before they
searched. In the line of Supreme Court
decisions on which we have relied, the
question is not whether police ultimately
obtained a warrant; it is whether they
failed to do so within a reasonable time.
The Court has never suggested that this
type of violation is wholly exempt from
the exclusionary rule. See Place, 462
U.S. at 700, 103 S.Ct. 2637 (upholding
grant of motion to suppress because of a
delay of 90 minutes after seizing luggage
even though officers eventually searched
under a warrant); McArthur, 531 U.S. at
326, 121 S.Ct. 946 (finding delay in obtain-
ing a warrant reasonable without suggest-
ing that Leon’s good-faith rule would
have applied). Furthermore, removing
this sort of police misconduct from the
ambit of the exclusionary rule would have
significant implications: it would eliminate
the rule’s deterrent effect on unreason-
ably long seizures. Police could seize any
item—a phone, a computer, a briefcase, or
even a house—for an unreasonably long
time without concern for the conse-
quences, evidentiary and otherwise.

The Ninth Circuit appears to be the only
court that has specifically addressed this
question. In United States v. Song Ja
Cha the court held that “the exclusionary
rule is applicable where seizures are un-
constitutionally long” in order “to deter
unreasonable police behavior and to pro-
vide for judicial determination of probable
cause.” 597 F.3d 995, 1006 (9th Cir.2010).
It rejected the government’s argument
that the good-faith exception applied. In
contrast to Leon, in which it was reason-
able for a “well trained officer” to believe
the search warrant was supported by
probable cause, id. at 1005 (quoting Leon,
468 U.S. at 922 n. 23, 104 S.Ct. 3405), it is
unreasonable for officers to believe that a
1036

seizure may drag on “longer than neces-
sary for the police, acting diligently, to
obtain the warrant,” id. (quoting McAr-
thur, 531 U.S. at 332, 121 S.Ct. 946). The
court held that the exclusionary rule ap-
plied even under the Supreme Court’s
most recent good-faith case, Herring v.
United States, 555 U.S. 135, 129 S.Ct. 695,
172 L.Ed.2d 496 (2009), because the offi-
cer’s deliberate failure to seek a warrant
with diligence was “sufficiently culpable
that ... deterrence is worth the price paid
by the justice system.” Song Ja Cha, 597
F.3d at 1005 (quoting Herring, 555 U.S. at
144, 129 S.Ct. 695).

We do not categorically rule out the
possibility of a Leon argument in this line
of cases. There may be a situation in
which the unreasonableness of a delay is a
very close call, and an officer could not be
charged with knowledge that the delay
violated the law. See, e.g., United States
v. Pitts, 322 F.3d 449 (7th Cir.2003) (“Giv-
en our prior holdings in similar cases, and
given the disagreement over the reason-
ableness of the length of the detention by
the magistrate and the district court
judge, we do not believe the officer execut-
ing the warrant could be charged with
knowing the search was illegal ... even
though the magistrate authorized it.”). All
we say is that the good-faith exception is
not automatically available as soon as a
warrant materializes. A well-trained offi-
cer is presumed to be aware that a seizure
must last “no longer than reasonably nec-
essary for the police, acting with diligence,
to obtain a warrant.” McArthur, 531 U.S.
at 332, 121 S.Ct. 946. When police fail to
act with such diligence, exclusion will typi-
cally be the appropriate remedy.

The Supreme Court has never retreated
from the proposition that the exclusionary
rule applies to cases of unreasonable delay.
That said, we recognize that one might
imagine other remedies for the harm

caused in these situations—possibly some
kind of Fifth Amendment violation, or a
damages remedy for the loss of the use of
the phone. But those hypothetical possi-
bilities do not change the ruling in Segura
that the duration between a seizure of a
container and the issuance of a warrant to
search its contents may become unreason-
able for Fourth Amendment purposes,
thereby requiring suppression of the evi-
dence. 468 U.S. at 812, 104 S.Ct. 3380.
This case, however, just like Segura, is one
in which the delay was not constitutionally
unreasonable. We Arrirm the district
court’s denial of Burgard’s suppression
motion and thus the judgment of the court.
