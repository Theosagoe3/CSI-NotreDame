786 F.3d at 723-24 (quoting Powell, 838
P.2d at 927, vacated on other grounds, 511
US. 79, 114 S.Ct. 1280, 128 L.Ed.2d 1
(1994)). But, in 2000, “the Nevada Su-
preme Court again reversed course, abro-
gating Powell” by holding in Byford that
the first-degree murder statute includes
three separate mens rea elements. Riley
I, 786 F.3d at 724. Byford explained that
“in Powell we overlooked earlier pro-
nouncements of this court which recog-
nized that ‘deliberate’ and ‘premeditated’
define distinct elements.” Byford, 994 P.2d
at 713-14 (citing Hern, 635 P.2d at 280).
In interpreting Byford, Nika explained it
amounted to a “change in state law” that
“abandoned the line of cases starting with
Powell.” Nika, 198 P.3d at 847, 849. So for
a short period—from 1992 to 2000—Neva-
da operated under the principle that the
three elements were merged. However,
this occurred after Riley’s conviction was
final. Thus, before and after Powell, the
Nevada Supreme Court interpreted its
first-degree murder statute to include
three distinct mens rea elements—an in-
terpretation to which we defer.

Because there was no change in Nevada
law that affects Riley I’s interpretation of
the required elements for first-degree
murder in Nevada when Riley’s conviction
became final, the district court did not
abuse its discretion by denying the State’s
motion under Rule 60(b)(6). The judgment
of the district court is AFFIRMED.

No. 18-50204

United States Court of Appeals,
Ninth Circuit.

Argued and Submitted May 17,
2019 Pasadena, California
Filed August 9, 2019

Background: Mail fraud and firearm de-

fendant moved to suppress evidence dis-

covered during a search of laptop seized
from his residence, and the United States

District Court for the Central District of

California, No. 2:17-cr-00003-GW-1,

George H. Wu, J., granted motion. Govern-

ment appealed.

Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Korman,

District Judge, sitting by designation, held

that:

(1) even if affidavit in support of warrant
for search of suspect’s residence for
evidence of marijuana growing opera-
tion was insufficient to establish prob-
able cause for seizure of suspect’s
laptop, evidence did not have to be
suppressed, and

(2) officer’s 21-day delay in applying for
warrant to search laptop that had pre-
viously been seized during a warranted
search of suspected marijuana grow-
er’s residence did not warrant applica-
tion of exclusionary rule.

Reversed.

Mere fact that a Fourth Amendment
violation has occurred does not necessarily

mean that the exclusionary rule applies.

Cite as 933 F.3d 1074 (9th Cir. 2019)

2. Criminal Law 392.37

To trigger application of the exclu-
sionary rule, police conduct must be suffi-
ciently deliberate that exclusion can mean-
ingfully deter it, and sufficiently culpable
that such deterrence is worth the price
paid by the justice system.

3. Criminal Law ¢-1139

On appeal from district court’s sup-
pression holding, the Court of Appeals re-
views whether the exclusionary rule was
properly applied de novo.

4, Criminal Law <=392.38(10)

Exclusionary rule does not apply to
officer’s objectively reasonable reliance on
a subsequently invalidated search warrant,
unless the warrant was based on affidavit
so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to
render official belief in its existence entire-
ly unreasonable; even if an affidavit fails to
establish probable cause, an officer cannot
be expected to question the magistrate’s
“probable cause” determination, unless the
affidavit is “bare bones,” as failing to pro-
vide a colorable argument for probable
cause. U.S. Const. Amend. 4.

5. Criminal Law ©=392.38(12)

Even if affidavit in support of warrant
for search of suspect’s residence for evi-
dence of marijuana growing operation was
insufficient to establish probable cause for
seizure of suspect’s laptop and other elec-
tronic devices, affidavit contained sufficient
information to make reasonable an officer’s
reliance on search warrant in seizing lap-
top, and thus weighed against application
of the exclusionary rule; affidavit set forth
facts indicative of large-scale marijuana
growing operation, including the suspect’s
having registered marijuana business and
the substantial, consistent foot traffic to
his residence late at night, such that there
was a colorable argument for probable
cause to seize items tending to establish
and document suspect’s sales of marijuana.
U.S. Const. Amend. 4.

6. Criminal Law <=392.16(2)

Federal law enforcement officer’s 21-
day delay in applying for warrant to
search laptop that had previously been
seized during a warranted search of sus-
pected marijuana grower’s residence, while
officer initially waited for determination as
to whether the case would be prosecuted
federally and after which officer drafted
warrant application, did not warrant appli-
cation of exclusionary rule and suppression
of evidence discovered during subsequent
search of laptop; officer, in securing war-
rant for search of suspect’s home and sec-
ond warrant for search of laptop, was at-
tempting to comply with his obligations
under the Fourth Amendment, and any
delay did not evince negligence, let alone
any deliberate and culpable misconduct on
his part. U.S. Const. Amend. 4.

7. Criminal Law 392.37

In connection, not with unconstitution-
al seizure, but with law enforcement offi-
cers’ allegedly unreasonable 21-day delay
in applying for warrant to search laptop
which they had previously seized, deter-
rent value of suppressing evidence in dis-
couraging such delay was only a necessary,
and not a sufficient, condition for applica-
tion of the exclusionary rule; in deciding
whether to apply rule, court also had to
account for substantial social costs gener-
ated by exclusionary rule. U.S. Const.
Amend. 4.

8. Criminal Law ¢392.37

Prior to suppressing evidence ob-
tained in search of defendant’s laptop,
based upon law enforcement officers’ alleg-
edly unreasonable 21-day delay in applying
for warrant to search laptop after it was
seized, court had to determine that deter-
rence of such delay was worth the price
paid by the justice system. U.S. Const.
Amend. 4.
1076

9. Criminal Law ©392.38(1)

Court’s analysis in deciding whether
to apply exclusionary rule is objective in
nature; court must consider whether a rea-
sonably well trained officer would have
known that search was illegal. U.S. Const.
Amend. 4.

10. Criminal Law 392.37

The greater the distance between the
actions of a reasonably well trained officer
and the actions of officer in a particular
case, the more likely it is that exclusion is
the proper remedy for any violation of
defendant’s rights.

11. Criminal Law 392.37

Application of exclusionary rule to
suppress evidence is warranted to deter
deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent
conduct.

12. Criminal Law 392.37

Even if police conduct is not deliber-
ate, reckless, or grossly negligent, recur-
ring or systemic negligence alone may
warrant deterrence through application of
exclusionary rule.

*The Honorable Edward R. Korman, United
States District Judge for the Eastern District

933 FEDERAL REPORTER, 3d SERIES

Before: Kim McLane Wardlaw and
Andrew D. Hurwitz, Circuit Judges, and
Edward R. Korman,* District Judge.

OPINION
KORMAN, District Judge:

On or about October 26, 2016, Depart-
ment of Homeland Security (“DHS”)
agents received a tip that marijuana was
being grown at an address in Van Nuys,
California. The tipper stated that shortly
after Royce Jobe moved in next door, “a
brown privacy fence was constructed to
hide the view of the detached garage on
the property,” “a strong smell of marijua-
na” began emanating from the house, and
there had been “a lot of activity in the late
evening at the house including multiple
vehicles arriving and individuals coming
and going.” On or about November 3, Spe-
cial Agent Paul Cotcher found that the
utilities account associated with the resi-
dence was not registered under Jobe’s
name. Cotcher prepared an affidavit out-
lining the information in the tip and stat-
ing that power use for the property had
spiked, Jobe had prior convictions for pos-
session of a firearm and marijuana, and
Jobe had a business registered as “420
Boutique,” a reference to marijuana. The
affidavit also stated that Cotcher had ob-
served “PVC piping, planters, and cooling
fans” attached to and around the garage.

Based on that affidavit, on November
21, a California state judge issued a war-
rant authorizing a search of Jobe’s resi-
dence and the seizure of certain property,
including “[a]rticles of personal property
tending to establish and document sales of
{marijuana,] including hard
drives.” The next day, on November 22,
Cotcher and other officers executed the

of New York, sitting by designation.
US. v. JOBE

1077

Cite as 933 F.3d 1074 (9th Cir. 2019)

warrant and seized, among other items,
drugs, a pistol, Jobe’s laptop and other
electronic devices. The laptop was not
searched at that time.

After the evidence was seized, Cotcher
contacted the United States Attorney’s Of-
fice (“‘USAO”) to ask whether the case
would be prosecuted federally. Over the
next ten days, Cotcher continued his inves-
tigation: He logged and arranged for stor-
age of seized evidence, obtained Jobe’s
rental application and lease agreement, in-
terviewed a postal employee who stated
that Jobe mailed packages three to four
times a week, and interviewed individuals
whose names were tied to the utilities ac-
counts Jobe used. On or about December
1, Cotcher was informed that the case
would be prosecuted federally. He began
drafting an affidavit in support of a crimi-
nal complaint and a federal warrant to
search the laptop, which he completed on
or about December 7. On December 12,
twenty days after the laptop was seized,
the complaint was filed and the warrant
was signed. That same day, agents
searched Jobe’s laptop. The laptop con-
tained messages indicating that Jobe had
stolen credit card and bank account infor-
mation. He was charged with identity
theft, accessing devices without authoriza-
tion, mail fraud, and being a felon in pos-
session of a firearm.

Jobe moved to suppress the evidence
found on the laptop. The district judge
granted the motion, finding that, while the
state seizure warrant was supported by
probable cause, the government unreason-
ably delayed before obtaining a second
warrant to search Jobe’s computer. The
government timely appealed that order.
We have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C.
§ 3731 and reverse.

DISCUSSION
[1-3] “The fact that a Fourth Amend-
ment violation occurred ... does not nec-

essarily mean that the exclusionary rule
applies.” Herring v. United States, 555
US. 135, 140, 129 S.Ct. 695, 172 L.Ed.2d
496 (2009).
To trigger the exclusionary rule, police
conduct must be sufficiently deliberate
that exclusion can meaningfully deter it,
and sufficiently culpable that such deter-
rence is worth the price paid by the
justice system. As laid out in [the Su-
preme Court’s] cases, the exclusionary
rule serves to deter deliberate, reckless,
or grossly negligent conduct, or in some
circumstances recurring or systemic
negligence.

Id. at 144. We review whether the exclu-
sionary rule was properly applied de novo.
United States v. Luong, 470 F.3d 898, 902
(9th Cir. 2006).

I. The State Warrant

[4] We begin with an assessment of
the seizure of Jobe’s laptop pursuant to
the state warrant. The exclusionary rule
does not apply to an officer’s “objectively
reasonable reliance on a subsequently in-
validated search warrant,” unless the war-
rant was “based on an affidavit ‘so lacking
in indicia of probable cause as to render
official belief in its existence entirely un-
reasonable.’” United States v. Leon, 468
U.S. 897, 922-23, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82
L.Ed.2d 677 (1984) (quoting Brown v. Illi-
nois, 422 U.S. 590, 610-11, 95 S.Ct. 2254,
45 L.Ed.2d 416 (1975) (Powell, J., concur-
ring in part)). Even if an affidavit fails to
establish probable cause, “an officer can-
not be expected to question the magis-
trate’s probable-cause determination,” id.
at 921, 104 S.Ct. 3405, unless the affidavit
is “bare bones,” i.¢., “it fails to provide a
colorable argument for probable cause,”
United States v. Underwood, 725 F.3d
1076, 1085 (9th Cir. 2013).

[5] We accept that there was insuffi-
cient probable cause to seize the laptop.
1078

The state judge “lacked a substantial basis
for concluding that probable cause existed”
to seize the laptop because Cotcher’s affi-
davit did not mention a computer or any
electronic devices, much less state any
facts suggesting that Jobe’s laptop would
likely contain evidence of a marijuana
growing operation. Jd. at 1081 (internal
quotation and alteration marks omitted)
(quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213,
238-39, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527
(1983)). Nevertheless, Cotcher’s affidavit
supporting the state warrant contained
sufficient information to render his reli-
ance on the warrant reasonable. It laid out
facts indicative of a large-scale marijuana
growing operation, including information
from a tipper that was corroborated by
Cotcher’s own observations, investigation,
and experience. Given the apparent scale
of Jobe’s operation, as indicated by his
having a registered marijuana business
and the substantial, consistent foot traffic
to his residence late at night, the affidavit
provided “a colorable argument for proba-
ble cause,” id. at 1085, to seize items
“tending to establish and document sales
of marijuana.” Cotcher reasonably relied
on the warrant’s authorization to seize di-
gital devices, such as Jobe’s laptop, that
might contain such documents.

Ii. The Federal Warrant

[6] Jobe argues that even if the seizure
of the laptop under the state warrant does
not provide a basis for exclusion, the twen-
ty-day delay between that seizure and the
subsequent execution of the federal search
warrant justifies suppression. Even assum-
ing that the delay was unreasonable, we
disagree.

The exclusionary rule has traditionally
been driven by one primary policy consid-
eration: the deterrence of unconstitutional
acts by law enforcement. United States v.
Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 348, 94 S.Ct. 613,
38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974) (“[T]he [exclusion-
ary] rule is a judicially created remedy

933 FEDERAL REPORTER, 3d SERIES

designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment
rights generally through its deterrent ef-
fect ....”); see also Leon, 468 U.S. at 909,
104 S.Ct. 3405. The rule effects this goal in
different ways, depending on the case. The
most common is preventing police from
benefiting from evidence obtained as a re-
sult of a constitutional violation, thereby
removing the incentive to violate the Con-
stitution to obtain evidence. See, e.g., Unit-
ed States v. Artis, 919 F.3d 1123, 1133-34
(9th Cir. 2019); United States v. Camou,
773 F.3d 932, 944-45 (9th Cir. 2014).

[7,8] But in another category of cases,
police misconduct effectively bears no
“fruit.” See United States v. Cha, 597 F.3d
995, 1003 (9th Cir. 2010). Unreasonable
delays fall into this latter category. See id.
In those cases, “deterrent value” is only “a
necessary condition for exclusion, ... not a
sufficient one. The analysis must also ac-
count for the substantial social costs gen-
erated by the [exclusionary] rule.” Davis v.
United States, 564 U.S. 229, 237, 131 S.Ct.
2419, 180 L.Ed.2d 285 (2011) (quotation
marks and citation omitted). Put another
way, a court must determine that “deter-
rence is worth the price paid by the justice
system” before suppressing evidence. Her-
ring, 555 USS. at 144, 129 S.Ct. 695.

[9,10] Cha is our only prior decision
addressing the issue posed in Herring in
the context of delays. See United States v.
Burgard, 675 F.3d 1029, 1035 (7th Cir.
2012) (so recognizing). Cha laid out several
guideposts to follow. First, the analysis is
objective in nature. See Cha, 597 F.3d at
1005; see also Herring, 555 U.S. at 145,
129 S.Ct. 695. We must consider “whether
a reasonably well trained officer would
have known that the search was illegal.”
Leon, 468 U.S. at 922 n.23, 104 S.Ct. 3405.
The greater the distance between the ac-
tions of a “reasonably well trained officer”
and the actions of an officer in a particular
case, the more likely it is that exclusion is
US. v. JOBE

1079

Cite as 933 F.3d 1074 (9th Cir. 2019)

the proper remedy. See Cha, 597 F.3d at
1005 (“T]he police officers were a far
stretch from Leon’s ‘reasonably well
trained officer.’ ”).

[11] Cha and Herring also explain that
suppression is warranted “to deter deliber-
ate, reckless, or grossly negligent con-
duct.” Herring, 555 U.S. at 144, 129 S.Ct.
695. We summarized the misconduct in
Cha as follows:

The police seized the Cha’s house for a

minimum of 26.5 hours while Mr. Cha

waited outside for the majority of the
time—even to the early hours of the
morning. The police refused to allow

Mr. Cha to enter his house accompanied

by a police officer to retrieve his diabe-

tes medication for four hours.

[NJone of this delay was “unavoid-

able”—the officers had probable cause

at 1 am., and ... could have drafted
the warrant application at least after the

12 p.m. briefing. The officers, however,

had a “nonchalant attitude” and pro-

ceeded in a “relaxed fashion.”

Cha, 597 F.3d at 1005-06. Such facts dem-
onstrate more than sufficient culpability
that exclusion is worth the costs. Herring,
555 U.S. at 144, 129 S.Ct. 695; see also
Leon, 468 U.S. at 911, 104 S.Ct. 3405
(“[AJ]n assessment of the flagrancy of the
police misconduct constitutes an important
step in the calculus.”).

Cotcher’s behavior is  far-removed.
There is no indication that Cotcher delib-
erately tarried or received insufficient
training. Rather, immediately after seizing
the laptop, he contacted the USAO about
prosecuting the case federally. During the
ten days between that initial contact and
being told that the USAO would handle
the case—a period which included the
Thanksgiving holiday—Cotcher continued
with his investigation. Once the USAO re-
sponded to his inquiry, he began drafting a
detailed and lengthy affidavit in support of
a federal search warrant, which he finished

less than a week later and then transmit-
ted to an Assistant U.S. Attorney. Jobe
contends that Cotcher could have prepared
an affidavit even without hearing from the
USAO. But it is USAO policy to review
warrant applications prior to their submis-
sion to a magistrate, so a reasonable offi-
cer in Cotcher’s position could have be-
lieved that he could not submit his warrant
application until the USAO decided to pro-
ceed. While Cotcher could have been more
efficient in preparing an application, his
delay does not evince negligence, let alone
deliberate and culpable misconduct.

[12] Even if police conduct is not “de-
liberate, reckless, or grossly negligent,”
“recurring or systemic negligence” alone
may warrant deterrence through exclu-
sion. Herring, 555 U.S. at 144, 129 S.Ct.
695. Here, however, the record does not
suggest that such conduct will recur. In-
deed, if there were evidence of repeated
delays, Cotcher’s behavior would no longer
qualify as “isolated police negligence.”
Cha, 597 F.3d at 1004.

More significantly, Cotcher obtained one
warrant before seizing Jobe’s laptop and a
second warrant before searching it, where-
as the officers in Cha waited until after the
home had been seized to obtain any war-
rant. Cotcher’s good-faith efforts to comply
with the Warrant Clause of the Fourth
Amendment indicate that his conduct was
not “sufficiently culpable that such deter-
rence is worth the price paid by the justice
system.” Herring, 555 U.S. at 144, 129
S.Ct. 695. Critically, there are no allega-
tions that the affidavit presented to the
magistrate to obtain the federal search
warrant omitted or misrepresented any in-
formation. See Leon, 468 U.S. at 923, 104
S.Ct. 3405 (“Suppression ... remains an
appropriate remedy if the magistrate or
judge in issuing a warrant was misled by
information in an affidavit that the affiant
knew was false or would have known was
1080

false except for his reckless disregard of
the truth.”). Nor does Jobe challenge that
probable cause supported the federal war-
rant. See id. (“Nor would an officer mani-
fest objective good faith in relying on a
warrant based on an affidavit ‘so lacking in
indicia of probable cause as to render offi-
cial belief in its existence entirely unrea-
sonable.” (quoting Brown, 422 U.S. at
610-11, 95 S.Ct. 2254 (Powell, J., concur-
ring in part))).

Nor is there any indication that Cotcher
believed he was depriving Jobe of a legiti-
mate possessory interest. Rather, he rea-
sonably believed that the laptop was law-
fully seized pursuant to the state warrant.
We have previously held that a twenty-
one-day delay between the seizure of a
laptop and obtaining a warrant is reason-
able where the laptop is lawfully seized
pursuant to an individual’s consent. See
United States v. Sullivan, 797 F.3d 623,
634 (9th Cir. 2015).

Jobe’s reliance on United States v. Dass,
849 F.2d 414 (9th Cir. 1988), is misplaced.
That case involved delays of between sev-
en and twenty-three days in obtaining war-
rants to search hundreds of packages that
were seized without a warrant at a post
office in Hawaii. Id. at 414. Here, the
initial seizure of the laptop was pursuant
to a warrant.

The order granting Jobe’s motion to
suppress is REVERSED.
