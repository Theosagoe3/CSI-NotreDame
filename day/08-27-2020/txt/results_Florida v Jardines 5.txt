FLORIDA v. JARDINES

allocation of medical expenses in every
case. The Court views the problem with
North Carolina’s law as being that “the
State provides no evidence to substantiate
its claim that the one-third allocation is
reasonable in the mine run of cases.”
Ante, at 1399. That thought does not re-
surface until five pages later—and only
then—when the Court says that States
“may even be able to adopt ex ante admin-
istrative criteria for allocating medical and
nonmedical expenses, provided these crite-
ria are backed by evidence suggesting that
they are likely to yield reasonable results
in the mine run of cases.” Ante, at 1402.

I am not sure whether this is a conces-
sion that individualized hearings may not
be required after all, but if it is, it is flatly
contrary to the rest of the opinion. It is
also quite odd to suggest that the problem
with North Carolina’s law would go away if
only the State provided some sort of study
substantiating the idea that one-third was
a good approximation in most cases.
North Carolina is not a federal agency,
whose actions are subject to review under
the Administrative Procedure Act’s “sub-
stantial evidence” test. See 5 U.S.C.
§ 706(2)(E). We have never before, in a
preemption case, put the burden on the
State to compile an evidentiary record sup-
porting its legislative determination. The
burden is, of course, on those challenging
the law. See Pharmaceutical Research
and Mfrs. of America v. Walsh, 538 U.S.
644, 661-662, 123 S.Ct. 1855, 155 L.Ed.2d
889 (2003) (plurality opinion) (“We start
... with a presumption that the state stat-
ute is valid, and ask whether petitioner has
shouldered the burden of overcoming that
presumption” (citation omitted)). We have
said that, as a general matter, “Congress
is not obligated, when enacting its statutes,
to make a record of the type that an
administrative agency or court does to ac-
commodate judicial review.” Turner
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 520

US. 180, 213, 117 S.Ct. 1174, 137 L.Ed.2d
369 (1997) (internal quotation marks omit-
ted). Sovereign States should be accorded
no less deference.

Keep in mind that the basis for all this is
a federal law that prohibits liens for medi-
cal assistance, but says nothing about how
medical and nonmedical expenses are to be
allocated. It is hard enough to figure out
what the Medicaid Act means by what it
says ; we should not read so much into its
silence.

Ultimately, it is a basic policy judgment
whether the Medicaid program is best
served in this instance by post hoc individ-
ualized determinations, or whether the is-
sue may be addressed in advance, through
a general rule, as North Carolina has done
here. See ante, at 1402 (BREYER, J.,
concurring) (“any of several different an-
swers to the question would seem reason-
able”). The Court can point to nothing
that delegates to it the prerogative to
make that judgment. Rather, States and
the Secretary—working together—should
be afforded the leeway to make their joint
venture a workable one.

Because North Carolina’s law does not
conflict with federal law, I would let it be.
I respectfully dissent.

Background: Defendant, who
charged with trafficking in cannabis and

was

theft of electricity, moved to suppress evi-

dence seized pursuant to a search warrant

that was obtained after a dog-sniff on front
porch of defendant’s home. The Florida

Circuit Court, Miami-Dade County, Wil-

liam Thomas, J., granted the motion. State

appealed. The Florida District Court of

Appeal, 9 So.3d 1, reversed and certified a

conflict. The Florida Supreme Court, Per-

ry, J., 73 So.3d 34, quashed the decision of
the District Court of Appeal. Certiorari
was granted.

Holdings: The Supreme Court, Justice

Scalia, held that:

(1) law enforcement officers’ use of drug-
sniffing dog on front porch of home, to
investigate an unverified tip that mari-
juana was being grown in the home,
was a trespassory invasion of the curti-
lage which constituted a “search” for
Fourth Amendment purposes, and

officers did not have an implied license
for the physical invasion of the curti-
lage.

Florida Supreme Court affirmed.

Justice Kagan filed a concurring opinion,
in which Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor
joined.

Justice Alito filed a dissenting opinion, in
which Chief Justice Roberts and Justices
Kennedy and Breyer joined.

promptly, wait briefly to be received, and
then, absent invitation to linger longer,
leave.

Police took a drug-sniffing dog to Jar-
dines’ front porch, where the dog gave a
positive alert for narcotics. Based on the
alert, the officers obtained a warrant for a
search, which revealed marijuana plants;
Jardines was charged with trafficking in
cannabis. The Supreme Court of Florida
approved the trial court’s decision to sup-
press the evidence, holding that the offi-
cers had engaged in a Fourth Amendment
search unsupported by probable cause.

Justice SCALIA delivered the opinion of
the Court.

We consider whether using a drug-sniff-
ing dog on a homeowner’s porch to investi-
gate the contents of the home is a “search”
within the meaning of the Fourth Amend-
ment.

I

In 2006, Detective William Pedraja of
the Miami-Dade Police Department re-
ceived an unverified tip that marijuana
was being grown in the home of respon-
dent Joelis Jardines. One month later, the
Department and the Drug Enforcement
Administration sent a joint surveillance
team to Jardines’ home. Detective Pedra-
ja was part of that team. He watched the
home for fifteen minutes and saw no vehi-
cles in the driveway or activity around the
home, and could not see inside because the
blinds were drawn. Detective Pedraja
then approached Jardines’ home accompa-
nied by Detective Douglas Bartelt, a
trained canine handler who had just ar-
rived at the scene with his drug-sniffing
dog. The dog was trained to detect the
scent of marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and
several other drugs, indicating the pres-
ence of any of these substances through
particular behavioral changes recognizable
by his handler.

Detective Bartelt had the dog on a six-
foot leash, owing in part to the dog’s “wild”
nature, App. to Pet. for Cert. A-35, and
tendency to dart around erratically while
searching. As the dog approached Jar-
dines’ front porch, he apparently sensed
one of the odors he had been trained to
detect, and began energetically exploring
the area for the strongest point source of
that odor. As Detective Bartelt explained,
the dog “began tracking that airborne odor
by ... tracking back and forth,” engaging

in what is called “bracketing,” “back and
forth, back and forth.” Jd., at A-383 to A-
34. Detective Bartelt gave the dog “the full
six feet of the leash plus whatever safe
distance [he could] give him” to do this—
he testified that he needed to give the dog
“as much distance as I can.” Id., at A-35.
And Detective Pedraja stood back while
this was occurring, so that he would not
“get knocked over” when the dog was
“spinning around trying to find” the
source. Id., at A-38.

After sniffing the base of the front door,
the dog sat, which is the trained behavior
upon discovering the odor’s strongest
point. Detective Bartelt then pulled the
dog away from the door and returned to
his vehicle. He left the scene after in-
forming Detective Pedraja that there had
been a positive alert for narcotics.

On the basis of what he had learned at
the home, Detective Pedraja applied for
and received a warrant to search the resi-
dence. When the warrant was executed
later that day, Jardines attempted to flee
and was arrested; the search revealed
marijuana plants, and he was charged with
trafficking in cannabis.

At trial, Jardines moved to suppress the
marijuana plants on the ground that the
canine investigation was an unreasonable
search. The trial court granted the mo-
tion, and the Florida Third District Court
of Appeal reversed. On a petition for
discretionary review, the Florida Supreme
Court quashed the decision of the Third
District Court of Appeal and approved the
trial court’s decision to suppress, holding
(as relevant here) that the use of the
trained narcotics dog to investigate Jar-
dines’ home was a Fourth Amendment
search unsupported by probable cause,
rendering invalid the warrant based upon
information gathered in that search. 73
So.3d 34 (2011).
1414

We granted certiorari, limited to the
question of whether the officers’ behavior
was a search within the meaning of the
Fourth Amendment. 565 U.S. ——, 132
S.Ct. 995, 181 L.Ed.2d 726 (2012).

I

[1,2] The Fourth Amendment pro-
vides in relevant part that the “right of the
people to be secure in their persons, hous-
es, papers, and effects, against unreason-
able searches and seizures, shall not be
violated.” The Amendment establishes a
simple baseline, one that for much of our
history formed the exclusive basis for its
protections: When “the Government ob-
tains information by physically intruding”
on persons, houses, papers, or effects, “a
‘search’ within the original meaning of the
Fourth Amendment” has “undoubtedly oc-
curred.” United States v. Jones, 565 U.S.
——, — , n. 3, 182 S.Ct. 945, 950-951, n.
3, 181 L.Ed.2d 911 (2012). By reason of
our decision in Katz v. United States, 389
US. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576
(1967), property rights “are not the sole
measure of Fourth Amendment viola-
tions,” Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U.S. 56,
64, 113 S.Ct. 538, 121 L.Ed.2d 450 (1992)—
but though Katz may add to the baseline,
it does not subtract anything from the
Amendment’s protections “when the Gov-
ernment does engage in [a] physical intru-
sion of a constitutionally protected area,”
United States v. Knotts, 460 U.S. 276, 286,
103 S.Ct. 1081, 75 L.Ed.2d 55 (1983)
(Brennan, J., concurring in the judgment).

That principle renders this case a
straightforward one. The officers were
gathering information in an area belonging
to Jardines and immediately surrounding
his house—in the curtilage of the house,
which we have held enjoys protection as
part of the home itself. And they gath-
ered that information by physically enter-
ing and occupying the area to engage in

133 SUPREME COURT REPORTER

conduct not explicitly or implicitly permit-
ted by the homeowner.

A

[3,4] The Fourth Amendment “indi-
cates with some precision the places and
things encompassed by its protections”:
persons, houses, papers, and effects. Oli-
ver v. United States, 466 U.S. 170, 176, 104
S.Ct. 1735, 80 L.Ed.2d 214 (1984). The
Fourth Amendment does not, therefore,
prevent all investigations conducted on pri-
vate property; for example, an officer may
(subject to Katz) gather information in
what we have called “open fields”—even if
those fields are privately owned—because
such fields are not enumerated in the
Amendment’s text. Hester v. United
States, 265 U.S. 57, 44 S.Ct. 445, 68 L.Ed.
898 (1924).

[5] But when it comes to the Fourth
Amendment, the home is first among
equals. At the Amendment’s “very core”
stands “the right of a man to retreat into
his own home and there be free from
unreasonable governmental intrusion.”
Silverman v. United States, 365 U.S. 505,
511, 81 S.Ct. 679, 5 L.Ed.2d 734 (1961).
This right would be of little practical value
if the State’s agents could stand in a
home’s porch or side garden and trawl for
evidence with impunity; the right to re-
treat would be significantly diminished if
the police could enter a man’s property to
observe his repose from just outside the
front window.

[6,7] We therefore regard the area
“Immediately surrounding and associated
with the home”—what our cases call the
curtilage—as “part of the home itself for
Fourth Amendment purposes.” Oliver,
supra, at 180, 104 S.Ct. 1735. That princi-
ple has ancient and durable roots. Just as
the distinction between the home and the
open fields is “as old as the common law,”
Hester, supra, at 59, 44 S.Ct. 445, so too is
FLORIDA v. JARDINES

1415

the identity of home and what Blackstone
called the “curtilage or homestall,” for the
“house protects and privileges all its
branches and appurtenants.” 4 W. Black-
stone, Commentaries on the Laws of Eng-
land 223, 225 (1769). This area around the
home is “intimately linked to the home,
both physically and psychologically,” and is
where “privacy expectations are most
heightened.” California v. Ciraolo, 476
US. 207, 213, 106 S.Ct. 1809, 90 L.Ed.2d
210 (1986).

[8] While the boundaries of the curti-
lage are generally “clearly marked,” the
“conception defining the curtilage” is at
any rate familiar enough that it is “easily
understood from our daily experience.”
Oliver, 466 U.S., at 182, n. 12, 104 S.Ct.
1735. Here there is no doubt that the
officers entered it: The front porch is the
classic exemplar of an area adjacent to the
home and “to which the activity of home
life extends.” Ibid.

B

[9-12] Since the officers’ investigation
took place in a constitutionally protected
area, we turn to the question of whether it
was accomplished through an unlicensed
physical intrusion.!_ While law enforce-
ment officers need not “shield their eyes”
when passing by the home “on public thor-
oughfares,” Ciraolo, 476 U.S., at 213, 106
S.Ct. 1809, an officer’s leave to gather
information is sharply circumscribed when
he steps off those thoroughfares and en-
ters the Fourth Amendment’s protected
areas. In permitting, for example, visual
observation of the home from “public navi-
gable airspace,” we were careful to note

1. At oral argument, the State and its amicus
the Solicitor General argued that Jardines
conceded in the lower courts that the officers
had a right to be where they were. This
misstates the record. Jardines conceded
nothing more than the unsurprising proposi-

that it was done “in a physically nonintru-
sive manner.” Jbid. Entick v. Carrington,
2 Wils. K.B. 275, 95 Eng. Rep. 807 (K.B.
1765), a case “undoubtedly familiar” to
“every American statesman” at the time of
the Founding, Boyd v. United States, 116
US. 616, 626, 6 S.Ct. 524, 29 L.Ed. 746
(1886), states the general rule clearly:
“{[Ojur law holds the property of every
man so sacred, that no man can set his foot
upon his neighbour’s close without his
leave.” 2 Wils. K.B., at 291, 95 Eng. Rep.,
at 817. As it is undisputed that the detec-
tives had all four of their feet and all four
of their companion’s firmly planted on the
constitutionally protected extension of Jar-
dines’ home, the only question is whether
he had given his leave (even implicitly) for
them to do so. He had not.

[13-15] “A license may be implied
from the habits of the country,” notwith-
standing the “strict rule of the English
common law as to entry upon a close.”
McKee v. Gratz, 260 U.S. 127, 136, 43 S.Ct.
16, 67 L.Ed. 167 (1922) (Holmes, J.). We
have accordingly recognized that “the
knocker on the front door is treated as an
invitation or license to attempt an entry,
justifying ingress to the home by solicitors,
hawkers and peddlers of all kinds.”
Breard v. Alexandria, 341 U.S. 622, 626,
71 S.Ct. 920, 95 L.Ed. 1233 (1951). This
implicit license typically permits the visitor
to approach the home by the front path,
knock promptly, wait briefly to be re-
ceived, and then (absent invitation to lin-
ger longer) leave. Complying with the
terms of that traditional invitation does not
require fine-grained legal knowledge; it is
generally managed without incident by the
Nation’s Girl Scouts and trick-or-treaters.”

tion that the officers could have lawfully ap-
proached his home to knock on the front door
in hopes of speaking with him. Of course,
that is not what they did.

2. With this much, the dissent seems to
agree—it would inquire into “ ‘the appear-
1416

Thus, a police officer not armed with a
warrant may approach a home and knock,
precisely because that is “no more than
any private citizen might do.” Kentucky
v. King, 563 US. ——, —, 181 S.Ct.
1849, 1862, 179 L.Ed.2d 865 (2011).

But introducing a trained police dog to
explore the area around the home in hopes
of discovering incriminating evidence is
something else. There is no customary
invitation to do that. An invitation to en-
gage in canine forensic investigation as-
suredly does not inhere in the very act of
hanging a knocker.’ To find a visitor
knocking on the door is routine (even if
sometimes unwelcome); to spot that same
visitor exploring the front path with a met-
al detector, or marching his bloodhound
into the garden before saying hello and
asking permission, would inspire most of
us to—well, call the police. The scope of a

specific purpose. Consent at a traffic stop

nalarming, etc., for a stranger to explore the
curtilage of the home with trained drug dogs.

3. The dissent insists that our argument must
rest upon “‘the particular instrument that De-
tective Bartelt used to detect the odor of mari-
juana’’—the dog. Post, at 1424. It is not the
dog that is the problem, but the behavior that
here involved use of the dog. We think a
typical person would find it “‘a cause for
great alarm’”’ (the kind of reaction the dis-
sent quite rightly relies upon to justify its no-
night-visits rule, post, at 1422) to find a
stranger snooping about his front porch with
or without a dog. The dissent would let the

to an officer’s checking out an anonymous
tip that there is a body in the trunk does
not permit the officer to rummage through
the trunk for narcotics. Here, the back-
ground social norms that invite a visitor to
the front door do not invite him there to
conduct a search.'

The State points to our decisions holding
that the subjective intent of the officer is
irrelevant. See Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563
US. —, 131 S.Ct. 2074, 179 L.Ed.2d
1149 (2011); Whren v. United States, 517
U.S. 806, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89
(1996). But those cases merely hold that a
stop or search that is objectively reason-
able is not vitiated by the fact that the
officer’s real reason for making the stop or
search has nothing to do with the validat-
ing reason. Thus, the defendant will not
be heard to complain that although he was
speeding the officer’s real reason for the
stop was racial harassment. See id., at
810, 818, 116 S.Ct. 1769. Here, however,
the question before the court is precisely

police do whatever they want by way of gath-
ering evidence so long as they stay on the
base-path, to use a baseball analogy—so long
as they “stick to the path that is typically used
to approach a front door, such as a paved
walkway.’ Ibid. From that vantage point
they can presumably peer into the house
through binoculars with impunity. That is
not the law, as even the State concedes. See
Tr. of Oral Arg. 6.

4. The dissent argues, citing King, that “gath-
ering evidence—even damning evidence—is a
lawful activity that falls within the scope of
the license to approach.” Post, at 1423. That
is a false generalization. What King estab-
lishes is that it is not a Fourth Amendment
search to approach the home in order to
speak with the occupant, because all are invit-
ed to do that. The mere “‘purpose of discover-
ing information,” post, at 1424, in the course
of engaging in that permitted conduct does
not cause it to violate the Fourth Amendment.
But no one is impliedly invited to enter the
protected premises of the home in order to do
nothing but conduct a search.
FLORIDA v. JARDINES

1417

Cite as 133 S.Ct. 1409 (2013)

whether the officer’s conduct was an objec-
tively reasonable search. As we have de-
scribed, that depends upon whether the
officers had an implied license to enter the
porch, which in turn depends upon the
purpose for which they entered. Here,
their behavior objectively reveals a pur-
pose to conduct a search, which is not what
anyone would think he had license to do.

Tl

The State argues that investigation by a
forensic narcotics dog by definition cannot
implicate any legitimate privacy interest.
The State cites for authority our decisions
in United States v. Place, 462 U.S. 696, 103
S.Ct. 2637, 77 L.Ed.2d 110 (1983), United
States v. Jacobsen, 466 U.S. 109, 104 S.Ct.
1652, 80 L.Ed.2d 85 (1984), and Illinois v.
Caballes, 543 U.S. 405, 125 S.Ct. 834, 160
L.Ed.2d 842 (2005), which held, respective-
ly, that canine inspection of luggage in an
airport, chemical testing of a substance
that had fallen from a parcel in transit,
and canine inspection of an automobile
during a lawful traffic stop, do not violate
the “reasonable expectation of privacy” de-
scribed in Katz.

Just last Term, we considered an argu-
ment much like this. Jones held that
tracking an automobile’s whereabouts us-
ing a physically-mounted GPS receiver is a
Fourth Amendment search. The Govern-
ment argued that the Katz standard
“show[ed] that no search occurred,” as the
defendant had “no ‘reasonable expectation
of privacy’” in his whereabouts on the
public roads, Jones, 565 U.S., at ——, 132
S8.Ct., at 950—a proposition with at least as
much support in our case law as the one
the State marshals here. See, e.g., United
States v. Knotts, 460 U.S. 276, 278, 103
S.Ct. 1081, 75 L.Ed.2d 55 (1983). But
because the GPS receiver had been physi-
cally mounted on the defendant’s automo-
bile (thus intruding on his “effects”), we

held that tracking the vehicle’s movements
was a search: a person’s “Fourth Amend-
ment rights do not rise or fall with the
Katz formulation.” Jones, supra, at ——,
132 S.Ct., at 950. The Katz reasonable-
expectations test “has been added to, not
substituted for,” the traditional property-
based understanding of the Fourth
Amendment, and so is unnecessary to con-
sider when the government gains evidence
by physically intruding on constitutionally
protected areas. Jones, supra, at ——,
132 S.Ct., at 951-952.

Thus, we need not decide whether the
officers’ investigation of Jardines’ home vi-
olated his expectation of privacy under
Katz. One virtue of the Fourth Amend-
ment’s property-rights baseline is that it
keeps easy cases easy. That the officers
learned what they learned only by physi-
cally intruding on Jardines’ property to
gather evidence is enough to establish that
a search occurred.

For a related reason we find irrelevant
the State’s argument (echoed by the dis-
sent) that forensic dogs have been com-
monly used by police for centuries. This
argument is apparently directed to our
holding in Kyllo v. United States, 533 U.S.
27, 121 S.Ct. 2038, 150 L.Ed.2d 94 (2001),
that surveillance of the home is a search
where “the Government uses a device that
is not in general public use” to “explore
details of the home that would previously
have been unknowable without physical
intrusion.” Id., at 40, 121 S.Ct. 2038 (em-
phasis added). But the implication of that
statement (inclusio unius est exclusio al-
terius ) is that when the government uses
a physical intrusion to explore details of
the home (including its curtilage), the an-
tiquity of the tools that they bring along is

irrelevant.
Eo * *

The government’s use of trained police
dogs to investigate the home and its imme-
1418

diate surroundings is a “search” within the
meaning of the Fourth Amendment. The
judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida
is therefore affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Justice KAGAN, with whom Justice
GINSBURG and Justice SOTOMAYOR
join, concurring.

For me, a simple analogy clinches this
case—and does so on privacy as well as
property grounds. A stranger comes to
the front door of your home carrying su-
per-high-powered binoculars. See ante, at
1416, n. 3. He doesn’t knock or say hello.
Instead, he stands on the porch and uses
the binoculars to peer through your win-
dows, into your home’s furthest corners.
It doesn’t take long (the binoculars are
really very fine): In just a couple of min-
utes, his uncommon behavior allows him to
learn details of your life you disclose to no
one. Has your “visitor” trespassed on
your property, exceeding the license you
have granted to members of the public to,
say, drop off the mail or distribute cam-
paign flyers? Yes, he has. And has he
also invaded your “reasonable expectation
of privacy,” by nosing into intimacies you
sensibly thought protected from disclo-
sure? Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347,
360, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967)
(Harlan, J., concurring). Yes, of course,
he has done that too.

That case is this case in every way that
matters. Here, police officers came to
Joelis Jardines’ door with a super-sensitive
instrument, which they deployed to detect
things inside that they could not perceive
unassisted. The equipment they used was
animal, not mineral. But contra the dis-
sent, see post, at 1420 (opinion of ALITO,
J.) (noting the ubiquity of dogs in Ameri-
can households), that is of no significance
in determining whether a search occurred.
Detective Bartelt’s dog was not your

neighbor’s pet, come to your porch on a
leisurely stroll. As this Court discussed
earlier this Term, drug-detection dogs are
highly trained tools of law enforcement,
geared to respond in distinctive ways to
specific scents so as to convey clear and
reliable information to their human part-
ners. See Florida v. Harris, 568 US.
——, 183 S.Ct. 1050, 1053-1054, 1056-
1057, 185 L.Ed.2d 61 (2013). They are to
the poodle down the street as high-pow-
ered binoculars are to a piece of plain
glass. Like the binoculars, a drug-detec-
tion dog is a specialized device for discov-
ering objects not in plain view (or plain
smell). And as in the hypothetical above,
that device was aimed here at a home—the
most private and inviolate (or so we ex-
pect) of all the places and things the
Fourth Amendment protects. Was this
activity a trespass? Yes, as the Court
holds today. Was it also an invasion of
privacy? Yes, that as well.

The Court today treats this case under a
property rubric; I write separately to note
that I could just as happily have decided it
by looking to Jardines’ privacy interests.
A decision along those lines would have
looked ... well, much like this one. It
would have talked about “ ‘the right of a
man to retreat into his own home and
there be free from unreasonable govern-
mental intrusion.’” Ante, at 1414 (quoting
Silverman v. United States, 365 U.S. 505,
511, 81 S.Ct. 679, 5 L.Ed.2d 734 (1961).
It would have insisted on maintaining the
“practical value” of that right by prevent-
ing police officers from standing in an
adjacent space and “trawl[ing] for evidence
with impunity.” Ante, at 1414. It would
have explained that “ ‘privacy expectations
are most heightened’ ” in the home and the
surrounding area. Ante, at 1414-1415
(quoting California v. Ciraolo, 476 US.
207, 213, 106 S.Ct. 1809, 90 L.Ed.2d 210
(1986)). And it would have determined
FLORIDA v. JARDINES

1419

Cite as 133 S.Ct. 1409 (2013)

that police officers invade those shared
expectations when they use trained canine
assistants to reveal within the confines of a
home what they could not otherwise have
found there. See ante, at 1415-1416, and
nn, 2-3.

It is not surprising that in a case involv-
ing a search of a home, property concepts
and privacy concepts should so align. The
law of property “naturally enough influ-
ence[s]” our “shared social expectations” of
what places should be free from govern-
mental incursions. Georgia v. Randolph,
547 U.S. 103, 111, 126 S.Ct. 1515, 164
L.Ed.2d 208 (2006); see Rakas v. Illinois,
439 U.S. 128, 143, n. 12, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58
L.Ed.2d 387 (1978). And so the sentiment
“my home is my own,” while originating in
property law, now also denotes a common
understanding—extending even beyond
that law’s formal protections—about an es-
pecially private sphere. Jardines’ home
was his property; it was also his most
intimate and familiar space. The analysis
proceeding from each of those facts, as
today’s decision reveals, runs mostly along
the same path.

I can think of only one divergence: If
we had decided this case on privacy
grounds, we would have realized that Kyl-
lo v. United States, 533 U.S. 27, 121 S.Ct.
2038, 150 L.Ed.2d 94 (2001), already re-
solved it.! The Kyllo Court held that po-
lice officers conducted a search when they
used a thermal-imaging device to detect
heat emanating from a private home, even

1. The dissent claims, alternatively, that J/li-
nois v. Caballes, 543 U.S. 405, 409-410, 125
S.Ct. 834, 160 L.Ed.2d 842 (2005), controls
this case (or nearly does). See post, at 1424,
1425. But Caballes concerned a drug-detec-
tion dog’s sniff of an automobile during a
traffic stop. See also Florida v. Harris, 568
Ws: , 133 S.Ct. 1050, — L.Ed.2d
(2013). And we have held, over and over
again, that people’s expectations of privacy
are much lower in their cars than in their

See, e.g., Arizona v. Gant, 556 U.S.

 

 

homes.

though they committed no trespass.
Highlighting our intention to draw both a
“firm” and a “bright” line at “the entrance
to the house,” id., at 40, 121 S.Ct. 2038, we
announced the following rule:

“Where, as here, the Government uses a

device that is not in general public use,

to explore details of the home that would
previously have been unknowable with-
out physical intrusion, the surveillance is

a ‘search’ and is presumptively unrea-

sonable without a warrant.” Ibid.

That “firm” and “bright” rule governs this
case: The police officers here conducted a
search because they used a “device ... not
in general public use” (a trained drug-
detection dog) to “explore details of the
home” (the presence of certain substances)
that they would not otherwise have discov-
ered without entering the premises.

And again, the dissent’s argument that
the device is just a dog cannot change the
equation. As Kyllo made clear, the
“sense-enhancing” tool at issue may be
“crude” or “sophisticated,” may be old or
new (drug-detection dogs actually go back
not “12,000 years” or “centuries,” post, at
1420, 1424, 1428, but only a few decades),
may be either smaller or bigger than a
breadbox; still, “at least where (as here)”
the device is not “in general public use,”
training it on a home violates our “minimal
expectation of privacy”’—an expectation
“that ewists, and that is acknowledged to
be reasonable.” 533 U.S., at 34, 36, 121
S.Ct. 2038.2 That does not mean the de-

Lewis, 417 U.S. 583, 590-591, 94 S.Ct. 2464,
41 L.Ed.2d 325 (1974) (plurality opinion).

2. The dissent’s other principal reason for con-
cluding that no violation of privacy occurred
in this case—that police officers themselves
might detect an aroma wafting from a
1420

vice is off-limits, as the dissent implies, see
post, at 1425-1426; it just means police
officers cannot use it to examine a home
without a warrant or exigent circumstance.
See Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U.S. 398,
403-404, 126 S.Ct. 1948, 164 L.Ed.2d 650
(2006) (describing exigencies allowing the
warrantless search of a home).

With these further thoughts, suggesting
that a focus on Jardines’ privacy interests
would make an “easy cas[e] easy” twice
over, ante, at 1417, I join the Court’s
opinion in full.

Justice ALITO, with whom THE
CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice KENNEDY,
and Justice BREYER join, dissenting.

The Court’s decision in this important
Fourth Amendment case is based on a
putative rule of trespass law that is no-
where to be found in the annals of Anglo-
American jurisprudence.

The law of trespass generally gives
members of the public a license to use a
walkway to approach the front door of a
house and to remain there for a brief time.
This license is not limited to persons who
intend to speak to an occupant or who
actually do so. (Mail carriers and persons
delivering packages and flyers are exam-

house—works no better. If officers can smell
drugs coming from a house, they can use that
information; a human sniff is not a search,
we can all agree. But it does not follow that
a person loses his expectation of privacy in
the many scents within his home that (his
own nose capably tells him) are not usually
detectible by humans standing outside. And
indeed, Kyllo already decided as much. In
response to an identical argument from the
dissent in that case, see 533 U.S., at 43, 121
S.Ct. 2038 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (noting
that humans can sometimes detect “heat
emanating from a building’), the Ky/lo Court
stated: “The dissent’s comparison of the ther-
mal imaging to various circumstances in
which outside observers might be able to per-
ceive, without technology, the heat of the
home ... is quite irrelevant. The fact that

ples of individuals who may lawfully ap-
proach a front door without intending to
converse.) Nor is the license restricted to
categories of visitors whom an occupant of
the dwelling is likely to welcome; as the
Court acknowledges, this license applies
even to “solicitors, hawkers and peddlers
of all kinds.” Ante, at 1415 (internal quo-
tation marks omitted). And the license
even extends to police officers who wish to
gather evidence against an occupant (by
asking potentially incriminating questions).

According to the Court, however, the
police officer in this case, Detective Bar-
telt, committed a trespass because he was
accompanied during his otherwise lawful
visit to the front door of respondent’s
house by his dog, Franky. Where is the
authority evidencing such a rule? Dogs
have been domesticated for about 12,000
years; ! they were ubiquitous in both this
country and Britain at the time of the
adoption of the Fourth Amendment; 2 and
their acute sense of smell has been used in
law enforcement for centuries.? Yet the
Court has been unable to find a single
case—from the United States or any other
common-law nation—that supports the
rule on which its decision is based. Thus,

equivalent information could sometimes be

ful the use of means that violate the Fourth
In any event, [at the time in
question,] no outside observer could have dis-
cerned the relative heat of Kyllo’s home with-

trespass law provides no support for the
Court’s holding today.

The Court’s decision is also inconsistent
with the reasonable-expectations-of-priva-
cy test that the Court adopted in Katz v.
United States, 389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507,
19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967). A reasonable per-
son understands that odors emanating
from a house may be detected from loca-
tions that are open to the public, and a
reasonable person will not count on the
strength of those odors remaining within
the range that, while detectible by a dog,
cannot be smelled by a human.

For these reasons, I would hold that no
search within the meaning of the Fourth
Amendment took place in this case, and I
would reverse the decision below.

I

The opinion of the Court may leave a
reader with the mistaken impression that
Detective Bartelt and Franky remained on
respondent’s property for a prolonged pe-
riod of time and conducted a far-flung
exploration of the front yard. See ante, at
1414 (“trawl for evidence with impunity”),
1416 (“marching his bloodhound into the
garden”). But that is not what happened.

Detective Bartelt and Franky ap-
proached the front door via the driveway
and a paved path—the route that any visi-
tor would customarily use ‘—and Franky
was on the kind of leash that any dog
owner might employ.’ As Franky ap-
proached the door, he started to track an
airborne odor. He held his head high and
began “bracketing” the area (pacing back
and forth) in order to determine the
strongest source of the smell. App. 95-96.

4. See App. 94; App. to Brief for Respondent
1A (depiction of respondent’s home).

5. The Court notes that Franky was on a 6-foot
leash, but such a leash is standard equipment
for ordinary dog owners. See, e.g., J. Stre-

Detective Bartelt knew “the minute [he]
observed” this behavior that Franky had
detected drugs. Jd., at 95. Upon locating
the odor’s strongest source, Franky sat at
the base of the front door, and at this
point, Detective Bartelt and Franky imme-
diately returned to their patrol car. Id., at
98.

A critical fact that the Court omits is
that, as respondent’s counsel explained at
oral argument, this entire process—walk-
ing down the driveway and front path to
the front door, waiting for Franky to find
the strongest source of the odor, and walk-
ing back to the car—took approximately a
minute or two. Tr. of Oral Arg. 57-58.
Thus, the amount of time that Franky and
the detective remained at the front porch
was even less. The Court also fails to
mention that, while Detective Bartelt ap-
parently did not personally smell the odor
of marijuana coming from the house, an-
other officer who subsequently stood on
the front porch, Detective Pedraja, did
notice that smell and was able to identify
it. App. 81.

II

The Court concludes that the conduct in
this case was a search because Detective
Bartelt exceeded the boundaries of the
license to approach the house that is rec-
ognized by the law of trespass, but the
Court’s interpretation of the scope of that
license is unfounded.

so. Breard v. Alexandria, 341 U.S. 622,

Lakin v. Ames, 64 Mass. 198, 220 (1852);
J. Bishop, Commentaries on the Non—Con-
tract Law § 823, p. 378 (1889). This rule
encompasses categories of visitors whom
most homeowners almost certainly wish to
allow to approach their front doors—
friends, relatives, mail carriers, persons
making deliveries. But it also reaches cat-
egories of visitors who are less universally
welcome—‘“solicitors,” “hawkers,” “ped-
dlers,” and the like. The law might at-
tempt to draw fine lines between catego-
ries of welcome and unwelcome visitors,
distinguishing, for example, between toler-
able and intolerable door-to-door peddlers
(Girl Scouts selling cookies versus adults
selling aluminum siding) or between police
officers on agreeable and disagreeable mis-
sions (gathering information about a both-
ersome neighbor versus asking potentially
incriminating questions). But the law of
trespass has not attempted such a difficult
taxonomy. See Desnick v. American
Broadcasting Cos. 44 F.3d 1345, 1351
(C.A.7 1995) (“[Clonsent to an entry is
often given legal effect even though the
entrant has intentions that if known to the
owner of the property would cause him for
perfectly understandable and generally
ethical or at least lawful reasons to revoke
his consent”); ef. Skinner v. Ogallala Pub-
lic School Dist., 262 Neb. 387, 402, 631
N.W.2d 510, 525 (2001) (“[I]n order to

plied, the inquiry is not a subjective as-

invitation has been implied from circum-
stances, such as custom,” and that this test
is “objective in that it stresses custom and

the appearance of things” as opposed to
“the undisclosed intention of the visitor”).

Of course, this license has certain spatial
and temporal limits. A visitor must stick
to the path that is typically used to ap-
proach a front door, such as a paved walk-
way. A visitor cannot traipse through the
garden, meander into the backyard, or
take other circuitous detours that veer
from the pathway that a visitor would cus-
tomarily use. See, e.g., Robinson v. Virgi-
nia, 47 Va.App. 533, 549-550, 625 S.E.2d
651, 659 (2006) (en bane); United States v.

vitation when they bypassed the front door
and proceeded directly to the back yard);

reasonable departure from an area where

ted)); 1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure

ments to places visitors could be expected

Nor, as a general matter, may a visitor
come to the front door in the middle of the
night without an express invitation. See
State v. Cada, 129 Idaho 224, 233, 923 P.2d
469, 478 (App.1996) (“Furtive intrusion late
at night or in the predawn hours is not
conduct that is expected from ordinary
visitors. Indeed, if observed by a resident
of the premises, it could be a cause for
great alarm”).

Similarly, a visitor may not linger at the
front door for an extended period. See 9
FLORIDA v. JARDINES

1423

Cite as 133 S.Ct. 1409 (2013)

So.3d 1, 11 (Fla.App.2008) (case below)
(Cope, J., concurring in part and dissent-
ing in part) (“[T]here is no such thing as
squatter’s rights on a front porch. A
stranger may not plop down uninvited to
spend the afternoon in the front porch
rocking chair, or throw down a sleeping
bag to spend the night, or lurk on the front
porch, looking in the windows”). The li-
cense is limited to the amount of time it
would customarily take to approach the
door, pause long enough to see if someone
is home, and (if not expressly invited to
stay longer), leave.

As I understand the law of trespass and
the scope of the implied license, a visitor
who adheres to these limitations is not
necessarily required to ring the doorbell,
knock on the door, or attempt to speak
with an occupant. For example, mail car-
riers, persons making deliveries, and indi-
viduals distributing flyers may leave the
items they are carrying and depart without
making any attempt to converse. A pe-
destrian or motorist looking for a particu-
Jar address may walk up to a front door in
order to check a house number that is
hard to see from the sidewalk or road. A
neighbor who knows that the residents are
away may approach the door to retrieve an
accumulation of newspapers that might
signal to a potential burglar that the house
is unoccupied.

As the majority acknowledges, this im-
plied license to approach the front door
extends to the police. See ante, at 1415.
As we recognized in Kentucky v. King, 563
US. —, 181 S.Ct. 1849, 179 L.Ed.2d 865
(2011), police officers do not engage in a
search when they approach the front door
of a residence and seek to engage in what
is termed a “knock and talk,” 7.e., knocking
on the door and seeking to speak to an
occupant for the purpose of gathering evi-
dence. See id., at ——, 131 S.Ct., at 1862
(“When law enforcement officers who are

not armed with a warrant knock on a door,
they do no more than any private citizen
might do”). See also 1 LaFave § 2.3(e), at
592 (“It is not objectionable for an officer
to come upon that part of the property
which has been opened to public common
use” (internal quotation marks omitted)).
Even when the objective of a “knock and
talk” is to obtain evidence that will lead to
the homeowner’s arrest and prosecution,
the license to approach still applies. In
other words, gathering evidence—even
damning evidence—is a lawful activity that
falls within the scope of the license to
approach. And when officers walk up to
the front door of a house, they are permit-
ted to see, hear, and smell whatever can be
detected from a lawful vantage point. Cal-
ifornia v. Ciraolo, 476 U.S. 207, 213, 106
S.Ct. 1809, 90 L.Ed.2d 210 (1986) (“The
Fourth Amendment protection of the home
has never been extended to require law
enforcement officers to shield their eyes
when passing by a home on public thor-
oughfares”); Cada, supra, at 232, 923
P.2d, at 477 (“[Plolice officers restricting
their activity to [areas to which the public
is impliedly invited] are permitted the
same intrusion and the same level of ob-
servation as would be expected from a
reasonably respectful citizen” (internal
quotation marks omitted)); 1 LaFave
§§ 2.2(a), 2.3(c), at 450-452, 572-577.

B

Detective Bartelt did not exceed the
scope of the license to approach respon-
dent’s front door. He adhered to the cus-
tomary path; he did not approach in the
middle of the night; and he remained at
the front door for only a very short period
(ess than a minute or two).

The Court concludes that Detective Bar-
telt went too far because he had the “ob-
jectivfe] ... purpose to conduct a search.”
Ante, at 1417 (emphasis added). What
1424

this means, I take it, is that anyone aware
of what Detective Bartelt did would infer
that his subjective purpose was to gather
evidence. But if this is the Court’s point,
then a standard “knock and talk” and most
other police visits would likewise constitute
searches. With the exception of visits to
serve warrants or civil process, police al-
most always approach homes with a pur-
pose of discovering information. That is
certainly the objective of a “knock and
talk.” The Court offers no meaningful
way of distinguishing the “objective pur-
pose” of a “knock and talk” from the “ob-
jective purpose” of Detective Bartelt’s con-
duct here.

The Court contends that a “knock and
talk” is different because it involves talk-
ing, and “all are invited” to do that. Ante,
at 1416, n. 4 (emphasis deleted). But a
police officer who approaches the front
door of a house in accordance with the
limitations already discussed may gather
evidence by means other than talking.
The officer may observe items in plain
view and smell odors coming from the
house. Ciraolo, supra, at 213, 106 S.Ct.
1809; Cada, 129 Idaho, at 232, 923 P.2d, at
ATT; 1 LaFave §§ 2.2(a), 2.3(¢), at 450-452,
572-577. So the Court’s “objective pur-
pose” argument cannot stand.

What the Court must fall back on, then,
is the particular instrument that Detective
Bartelt used to detect the odor of marijua-
na, namely, his dog. But in the entire
body of common-law decisions, the Court
has not found a single case holding that a
visitor to the front door of a home commits
a trespass if the visitor is accompanied by
a dog on a leash. On the contrary, the
common law allowed even unleashed dogs
to wander on private property without
committing a trespass. G. Williams, Lia-
bility for Animals 136-146 (1939); J. Ing-
ham, A Treatise on Property in Animals
Wild and Domestic and the Rights and

Responsibilities Arising Therefrom 277-
278 (1900). Cf. B. Markesinis & S. Dea-
kin, Tort Law 511 (4th ed. 1999).

The Court responds that “[iJt is not the
dog that is the problem, but the behavior
that here involved use of the dog.” Ante,
at 1416, n. 3. But where is the support in
the law of trespass for this proposition?
Dogs’ keen sense of smell has been used in
law enforcement for centuries. The antiq-
uity of this practice is evidenced by a
Scottish law from 1318 that made it a
crime to “disturb a tracking dog or the
men coming with it for pursuing thieves or
seizing malefactors.” K. Brown et al., The
Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to
1707, (St Andrews, 2007-2013), online at
http://www.rps.ac.uk/mss/1318/9. If bring-
ing a tracking dog to the front door of a
home constituted a trespass, one would
expect at least one case to have arisen
during the past 800 years. But the Court
has found none.

For these reasons, the real law of tres-
pass provides no support for the Court’s
holding today. While the Court claims
that its reasoning has “ancient and durable
roots,” ante, at 1414, its trespass rule is
really a newly struck counterfeit.

Il

The concurring opinion attempts to pro-
vide an alternative ground for today’s de-
cision, namely, that Detective Bartelt’s
conduct violated respondent’s reasonable
expectations of privacy. But we have al-
ready rejected a very similar, if not identi-
cal argument, see Illinois v. Caballes, 543
U.S. 405, 409-410, 125 S.Ct. 834, 160
L.Ed.2d 842 (2005), and in any event I see
no basis for concluding that the occupants
of a dwelling have a reasonable expecta-
tion of privacy in odors that emanate from
the dwelling and reach spots where mem-
bers of the public may lawfully stand.
FLORIDA v. JARDINES

1425

Cite as 133 S.Ct. 1409 (2013)

It is clear that the occupant of a house
has no reasonable expectation of privacy
with respect to odors that can be smelled
by human beings who are standing in such
places. See United States v. Johns, 469
US. 478, 482, 105 S.Ct. 881, 83 L.Ed.2d
890 (1985) (“After the officers came closer
and detected the distinct odor of marihua-
na, they had probable cause to believe that
the vehicles contained contraband”); Unit-
ed States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 111,
85 S.Ct. 741, 13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1965) (scent
of fermenting mash supported probable
cause for warrant); United States v. John-
ston, 497 F.2d 397, 398 (C.A.9 1974) (there
is no “reasonable expectation of privacy
from drug agents with inquisitive nos-
trils”). And I would not draw a line be-
tween odors that can be smelled by hu-
mans and those that are detectible only by
dogs.

Consider the situation from the point of
view of the occupant of a building in which
marijuana is grown or methamphetamine
is manufactured. Would such an occupant
reason as follows? “I know that odors
may emanate from my building and that
atmospheric conditions, such as the force
and direction of the wind, may affect the
strength of those odors when they reach a
spot where members of the public may
lawfully stand. I also know that some
people have a much more acute sense of
smell than others,’ and I have no idea who
might be standing in one of the spots in
question when the odors from my house
reach that location. In addition, I know
that odors coming from my building, when
they reach these locations, may be strong
enough to be detected by a dog. But I am
confident that they will be so faint that
they cannot be smelled by any human

6. Some humans naturally have a much more
acute sense of smell than others, and humans
can be trained to detect and distinguish odors
that could not be detected without such train-
ing. See E. Hancock, A Primer on Smell,

being.” Such a finely tuned expectation
would be entirely unrealistic, and I see no
evidence that society is prepared to recog-
nize it as reasonable.

In an attempt to show that respondent
had a reasonable expectation of privacy in
the odor of marijuana wafting from his
house, the concurrence argues that this
case is just like Kyllo v. United States, 533
US. 27, 121 S.Ct. 2038, 150 L.Ed.2d 94
(2001), which held that police officers con-
ducted a search when they used a thermal
imaging device to detect heat emanating
from a house. Ante, at 1419 (opinion of
KAGAN, J.). This Court, however, has
already rejected the argument that the use
of a drug-sniffing dog is the same as the
use of a thermal imaging device. See Ca-
balles, 543 U.S., at 409-410, 125 S.Ct. 834.
The very argument now advanced by the
concurrence appears in Justice Souter’s
Caballes dissent. See id., at 413, and n. 3,
125 S.Ct. 834. But the Court was not per-
suaded.

Contrary to the interpretation pro-
pounded by the concurrence, Kyllo is best
understood as a decision about the use of
new technology. The Kyllo Court focused
on the fact that the thermal imaging device
was a form of “sense-enhancing technolo-
gy” that was “not in general public use,”
and it expressed concern that citizens
would be “at the mercy of advancing tech-
nology” if its use was not restricted. 533
US., at 34-35, 121 S.Ct. 2038. A dog,
however, is not a new form of “technology”
or a “device.” And, as noted, the use of
dogs’ acute sense of smell in law enforce-
ment dates back many centuries.

http://www.jhu.edu/jhumag/996web/smell.
html. Some individuals employed in the per-
fume and wine industries, for example, have
an amazingly acute sense of smell. Ibid.
1426

The concurrence suggests that a Kyllo-
based decision would be “much like” the
actual decision of the Court, but that is
simply not so. The holding of the Court is
based on what the Court sees as a “ ‘physi-
cal intrusion of a constitutionally protected
area.” Ante, at 1414 (quoting United
States v. Knotts, 460 U.S. 276, 286, 103
S.Ct. 1081, 75 L.Ed.2d 55 (1983) (BREN-
NAN, J., concurring in judgment)). As a
result, it does not apply when a dog alerts
while on a public sidewalk or street or in
the corridor of a building to which the dog
and handler have been lawfully admitted.

The concurrence’s Kyllo-based approach
would have a much wider reach. When
the police used the thermal imaging device
in Kyllo, they were on a public street, 533
US., at 29, 121 S.Ct. 2038, and “committed
no trespass.” Ante, at 1419. Therefore, if
a dog’s nose is just like a thermal imaging
device for Fourth Amendment purposes, a
search would occur if a dog alerted while
on a public sidewalk or in the corridor of
an apartment building. And the same
would be true if the dog was trained to
sniff, not for marijuana, but for more dan-
gerous quarry, such as explosives or for a
violent fugitive or kidnapped child. I see
no ground for hampering legitimate law
enforcement in this way.

IV

The conduct of the police officer in this
case did not constitute a trespass and did
not violate respondent’s reasonable expec-
tations of privacy. I would hold that this
conduct was not a search, and I therefore
respectfully dissent.
