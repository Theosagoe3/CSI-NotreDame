brought his claims under federal statutes
that authorize fee awards to prevailing
plaintiffs’ attorneys. He contends that ap-
plication of the anticipatory assignment
principle would be inconsistent with the
purpose of statutory fee-shifting provi-
sions. See Venegas v. Mitchell, 495 U.S.
82, 86, 110 S.Ct. 1679, 109 L.Ed.2d 74
(1990) (observing that statutory fees en-
able “plaintiffs to employ reasonably com-
petent lawyers without cost to themselves
if they prevail”). In the federal system
statutory fees are typically awarded by the
court under the lodestar approach, Hens-
ley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433, 103
S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983), and the
plaintiff usually has little control over the
amount awarded. Sometimes, as when the
plaintiff seeks only injunctive relief, or
when the statute caps plaintiffs’ recoveries,
or when for other reasons damages are
substantially less than attorney’s fees,
court-awarded attorney’s fees can exceed a
plaintiff's monetary recovery. See, eg.
Riverside v. Rivera, 477 U.S. 561, 564-565,
106 S.Ct. 2686, 91 L.Ed.2d 466 (1986)
(compensatory and punitive damages of
$33,350; attorneys fee award of
$245,456.25). Treating the fee award as
income to the plaintiff in such cases, it is
argued, can lead to the perverse result
that the plaintiff loses money by winning
the suit. Furthermore, it is urged that
treating statutory fee awards as income to
plaintiffs would | ,;,undermine the effective-
ness of fee-shifting statutes in deputizing
plaintiffs and their lawyers to act as pri-
vate attorneys general.

We need not address these claims. Af-
ter Banks settled his case, the fee paid to
his attorney was calculated solely on the
basis of the private contingent-fee con-
tract. There was no court-ordered fee
award, nor was there any indication in
Banks’ contract with his attorney, or in the
settlement agreement with the defendant,
that the contingent fee paid to Banks’ at-

torney was in lieu of statutory fees Banks
might otherwise have been entitled to re-
cover. Also, the amendment added by the
American Jobs Creation Act redresses the
concern for many, perhaps most, claims
governed by fee-shifting statutes.

the dog alerted at respondent’s trunk, the

Justice STEVENS delivered the opinion
of the Court.

_Ligelllinois State Trooper Daniel Gillette
stopped respondent for speeding on an
interstate highway. When Gillette radioed
the police dispatcher to report the stop, a
second trooper, Craig Graham, a member
of the Illinois State Police Drug Interdic-
tion Team, overheard the transmission and
immediately headed for the scene with his
narcotics-detection dog. When they ar-
rived, respondent’s car was on the shoul-
der of the road and respondent was in
Gillette’s vehicle. While Gillette was in
the process of writing a warning ticket,
Graham walked his dog around respon-
dent’s car. The dog alerted at the trunk.
Based on that alert, the officers searched
the trunk, found marijuana, and arrested
respondent. The entire incident lasted
less than 10 minutes.

_LuRespondent was convicted of a nar-
cotics offense and sentenced to 12 years’
imprisonment and a $256,136 fine. The
trial judge denied his motion to suppress
the seized evidence and to quash his ar-
rest. He held that the officers had not
unnecessarily prolonged the stop and that
the dog alert was sufficiently reliable to
provide probable cause to conduct the
search. Although the Appellate Court af-
firmed, the Illinois Supreme Court re-
versed, concluding that because the canine
sniff was performed without any “ ‘specific
and articulable facts’” to suggest drug ac-
tivity, the use of the dog “unjustifiably

enlarg[ed] the scope of a routine traffic
stop into a drug investigation.” 207 Ill.2d
504, 510, 280 Ill.Dec. 277, 802 N.E.2d 202,
205 (2003).

The question on which we granted cer-
tiorari, 541 U.S. 972, 124 S.Ct. 1875, 158
L.Ed.2d 466 (2004), is narrow: “Whether
the Fourth Amendment requires reason-
able, articulable suspicion to justify using a
drug-detection dog to sniff a vehicle during
a legitimate traffic stop.” Pet. for Cert. i.
Thus, we proceed on the assumption that
the officer conducting the dog sniff had no
information about respondent except that
he had been stopped for speeding; accord-
ingly, we have omitted any reference to
facts about respondent that might have
triggered a modicum of suspicion.

[1,2] Here, the initial seizure of re-
spondent when he was stopped on the
highway was based on probable cause and
was concededly lawful. It is nevertheless
clear that a seizure that is lawful at its
inception can violate the Fourth Amend-
ment if its manner of execution unreason-
ably infringes interests protected by the
Constitution. United States v. Jacobsen,
466 U.S. 109, 124, 104 S.Ct. 1652, 80
L.Ed.2d 85 (1984). A seizure that is justi-
fied solely by the interest in issuing a
warning ticket to the driver can become
unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time
reasonably required to complete that mis-
sion. In an earlier case involving a dog
sniff that occurred during an unreasonably
prolonged traffic stop, the Illinois Supreme
Court held that use of the dog and the
subsequent discovery _|4,0f contraband
were the product of an unconstitutional
seizure. People v. Cow, 202 Ill.2d 462, 270
Ill.Dec. 81, 782 N.E.2d 275 (2002). We
may assume that a similar result would be
warranted in this case if the dog sniff had
been conducted while respondent was be-
ing unlawfully detained.

In the state-court proceedings, however,
the judges carefully reviewed the details of

Officer Gillette’s conversations with re-
spondent and the precise timing of his
radio transmissions to the dispatcher to
determine whether he had improperly ex-
tended the duration of the stop to enable
the dog sniff to occur. We have not re-
counted those details because we accept
the state court’s conclusion that the dura-
tion of the stop in this case was entirely
justified by the traffic offense and the
ordinary inquiries incident to such a stop.

Despite this conclusion, the Illinois Su-
preme Court held that the initially lawful
traffic stop became an unlawful seizure
solely as a result of the canine sniff that
occurred outside respondent’s stopped car.
That is, the court characterized the dog
sniff as the cause rather than the conse-
quence of a constitutional violation. In its
view, the use of the dog converted the
citizen-police encounter from a lawful traf-
fic stop into a drug investigation, and be-
cause the shift in purpose was not sup-
ported by any reasonable suspicion that
respondent possessed narcotics, it was un-
lawful. In our view, conducting a dog sniff
would not change the character of a traffic
stop that is lawful at its inception and
otherwise executed in a reasonable man-
ner, unless the dog sniff itself infringed
respondent’s constitutionally protected in-
terest in privacy. Our cases hold that it
did not.

[3,4] Official conduct that does not
“compromise any legitimate interest in pri-
vacy” is not a search subject to the Fourth
Amendment. Jacobsen, 466 U.S., at 123,
104 S.Ct. 1652. We have held that any
interest in possessing contraband cannot
be deemed “legitimate,” and thus, govern-
mental conduct that only reveals the pos-
session of contraband “compromises no le-
gitimate privacy interest.” Ibid. This is
because the expectations, “that certain
facts will not come to the attention of the
authorities” is not the same as an interest
838

in “privacy that society is prepared to
consider reasonable.” Jd, at 122, 104
S.Ct. 1652 (punctuation omitted). In Unit-
ed States v. Place, 462 U.S. 696, 103 S.Ct.
2637, 77 L.Ed.2d 110 (1983), we treated a
canine sniff by a well-trained narcotics-
detection dog as “swi generis” because it
“discloses only the presence or absence of
narcotics, a contraband item.” Jd., at 707,
103 S.Ct. 2637; see also Indianapolis v.
Edmond, 531 U.S. 32, 40, 121 S.Ct. 447,
148 L.Ed.2d 333 (2000). Respondent like-
wise concedes that “drug sniffs are de-
signed, and if properly conducted are gen-
erally likely, to reveal only the presence of
contraband.” Brief for Respondent 17.
Although respondent argues that the error
rates, particularly the existence of false
positives, call into question the premise
that drug-detection dogs alert only to con-
traband, the record contains no evidence
or findings that support his argument.
Moreover, respondent does not suggest
that an erroneous alert, in and of itself,
reveals any legitimate private information,
and, in this case, the trial judge found that
the dog sniff was sufficiently reliable to
establish probable cause to conduct a full-
blown search of the trunk.

[5,6] Accordingly, the use of a well-
trained narcotics-detection dog—one that
“does not expose noncontraband items that
otherwise would remain hidden from pub-
lic view,” Place, 462 U.S., at 707, 103 S.Ct.
2637—during a lawful traffic stop, general-
ly does not implicate legitimate privacy
interests. In this case, the dog sniff was
performed on the exterior of respondent’s
car while he was lawfully seized for a
traffic violation. Any intrusion on respon-
dent’s privacy expectations does not rise to
the level of a constitutionally cognizable
infringement.

[7] This conclusion is entirely consis-
tent with our recent decision that the use
of a thermal-imaging device to detect the

125 SUPREME COURT REPORTER

543 U.S. 409

growth of marijuana in a home constituted
an unlawful search. Kyllo v. United
States, 533 U.S. 27, 121 S.Ct. 2038, 150
L.Ed.2d 94 (2001). Critical to that deci-
sion was the fact that the device was capa-
ble of detecting lawful activity—in that
case, intimate details in a] j,home, such as
“at what hour each night the lady of the
house takes her daily sauna and bath.”
Id., at 38, 121 S.Ct. 2038. The legitimate
expectation that information about perfect-
ly lawful activity will remain private is
categorically distinguishable from respon-
dent’s hopes or expectations concerning
the nondetection of contraband in the
trunk of his car. A dog sniff conducted
during a concededly lawful traffic stop that
reveals no information other than the loca-
tion of a substance that no individual has
any right to possess does not violate the
Fourth Amendment.

The judgment of the Illinois Supreme
Court is vacated, and the case is remanded
for further proceedings not inconsistent
with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in
the decision of this case.

Justice SOUTER, dissenting.

I would hold that using the dog for the
purposes of determining the presence of
marijuana in the car’s trunk was a search
unauthorized as an incident of the speed-
ing stop and unjustified on any other
ground. I would accordingly affirm the
judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois,
and I respectfully dissent.

In United States v. Place, 462 U.S. 696,
103 S.Ct. 2637, 77 L.Ed.2d 110 (1983), we
categorized the sniff of the narcotics-seek-
ing dog as “swi generis” under the Fourth
Amendment and held it was not a search.
Id., at 707, 103 S.Ct. 2637. The classifica-
tion rests not only upon the limited nature
543 U.S. 412

ILLINOIS v. CABALLES

839

Cite as 125 S.Ct. 834 (2005)

of the intrusion, but on a further premise
that experience has shown to be untenable,
the assumption that trained sniffing dogs
do not err. What we have learned about
the fallibility of dogs in the years since
Place was decided would itself be reason
to call for reconsidering Place’s decision
against treating the intentional use of a
trained dog as a search. The portent of
this very case, however, adds insistjences,
to the call, for an uncritical adherence to
Place would render the Fourth Amend-
ment indifferent to suspicionless and indis-
criminate sweeps of cars in parking ga-
rages and pedestrians on sidewalks; if a
sniff is not preceded by a seizure subject
to Fourth Amendment notice, it escapes
Fourth Amendment review entirely unless
it is treated as a search. We should not
wait for these developments to occur be-
fore rethinking Place’s analysis, which in-
vites such untoward consequences.!

At the heart both of Place and the
Court’s opinion today is the proposition
that sniffs by a trained dog are sui generis
because a reaction by the dog in going
alert is a response to nothing but the
presence of contraband” See ibid.
(“[T}he sniff discloses only the presence or
absence of narcotics, a contraband item”);
ante, at 838 (assuming that “a canine sniff
by a well-trained narcotics-detection dog”
will only reveal “ ‘the presence or absence
of narcotics, a contraband item’” (quoting
Place, supra, at 707, 103 S.Ct. 2637)).
Hence, the argument goes, because the
sniff can only reveal the presence of items
devoid of any legal use, the sniff “does not

1. I also join Justice GINSBURG’s dissent,
post, p. 843. Without directly reexamining the
soundness of the Court’s analysis of govern-
ment dog sniffs in Place, she demonstrates
that investigation into a matter beyond the
subject of the traffic stop here offends the rule
in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20
L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), the analysis I, too, adopt.

2. Another proffered justification for sui gener-
is status is that a dog sniff is a particularly

implicate legitimate privacy interests” and
is not to be treated as a search. Ante, at
838.

The infallible dog, however, is a creature
of legal fiction. Although the Supreme
Court of Illinois did not get into the sniff-
ing averages of drug dogs, their supposed
infallibility is belied by judicial opinions
describing well-trained animals sniffing
and alerting with less than perfect accura-
cy, whether_|y.owing to errors by their
handlers, the limitations of the dogs them-
selves, or even the pervasive contamina-
tion of currency by cocaine. See, eg.
United States v. Kennedy, 131 F.3d 1371,
1378 (C.A.10 1997) (describing a dog that
had a 71% accuracy rate); United States v.
Scarborough, 128 F.3d 13738, 1378, n. 3
(C.A.10 1997) (describing a dog that erro-
neously alerted 4 times out of 19 while
working for the postal service and 8% of
the time over its entire career); United
States v. Limares, 269 F.3d 794, 797 (C.A.7
2001) (accepting as reliable a dog that gave
false positives between 7% and 38% of the
time); Laime v. State, 347 Ark. 142, 159,
60 S.W.3d 464, 476 (2001) (speaking of a
dog that made between 10 and 50 errors);
United States v. $242,484.00, 351 F.3d 499,
511 (C.A.11 2003) (noting that because as
much as 80% of all currency in circulation
contains drug residue, a dog alert “is of
little value”), vacated on other grounds by
rehearing en bane, 357 F.3d 1225 (C.A.11
2004); United States v. Carr, 25 F.3d 1194,

ring in part and dissenting in part) (“[A]

substantial portion of United States cur-
rency ... is tainted with sufficient traces
of controlled substances to cause a trained
canine to alert to their presence”). In-
deed, a study cited by Illinois in this case
for the proposition that dog sniffs are
“generally reliable” shows that dogs in ar-
tificial testing situations return false posi-
tives anywhere from 12.5% to 60% of the
time, depending on the length of the
search. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 13;
Federal Aviation Admin., K. Garner et al.,
Duty Cycle of the Detector Dog: A Base-
line Study 12 (Apr.2001) (prepared by Au-
burn U. Inst. for Biological Detection Sys-
tems). In practical terms, the evidence is
clear that the dog that alerts hundreds of
times will be wrong dozens of times.

Once the dog’s fallibility is recognized,
however, that ends the justification
claimed in Place for treating the sniff as
sut generis under the Fourth Amendment:
the sniff alert does not necessarily signal
hidden contraband, and opening the con-
tainer or enclosed space whose emanations
the dog has |4;sensed will not necessarily
reveal contraband or any other evidence of
crime. This is not, of course, to deny that
a dog’s reaction may provide reasonable
suspicion, or probable cause, to search the
container or enclosure; the Fourth
Amendment does not demand certainty of
success to justify a search for evidence or
contraband. The point is simply that the

3. Kyllo was concerned with whether a search
occurred when the police used a thermal-
imaging device on a house to detect heat
emanations associated with high-powered
marijuana-growing lamps. In concluding
that using the device was a search, the Court
stressed that the “Government [may not] us[e]
a device ... to explore details of the home
that would previously have been unknowable
without physical intrusion.” 533 U.S., at 40,
121 S.Ct. 2038. Any difference between the
dwelling in Kyllo and the trunk of the car
here may go to the issue of the reasonableness

125 SUPREME COURT REPORTER

543 U.S. 412

sniff and alert cannot claim the certainty
that Place assumed, both in treating the
deliberate use of sniffing dogs as sui gen-
eris and then taking that characterization
as a reason to say they are not searches
subject to Fourth Amendment scrutiny.
And when that aura of uniqueness disap-
pears, there is no basis in Place’s reason-
ing, and no good reason otherwise, to ig-
nore the actual function that dog sniffs
perform. They are conducted to obtain
information about the contents of private
spaces beyond anything that human senses
could perceive, even when conventionally
enhanced. The information is not provid-
ed by independent third parties beyond
the reach of constitutional limitations, but
gathered by the government’s own officers
in order to justify searches of the tradi-
tional sort, which may or may not reveal
evidence of crime but will disclose any-
thing meant to be kept private in the area
searched. Thus in practice the govern-
ment’s use of a trained narcotics dog func-
tions as a limited search to reveal undis-
closed facts about private enclosures, to be
used to justify a further and complete
search of the enclosed area. And given
the fallibility of the dog, the sniff is the
first step in a process that may disclose
“Sntimate details” without revealing con-
traband, just as a thermal-imaging device
might do, as described in Kyllo v. United
States, 533 U.S. 27, 121 S.Ct. 2038, 150
L.Ed.2d 94 (2001).

of the respective searches, but it has no bear-
ing on the question of search or no search.
Nor is it significant that Kyllo’s imaging de-
vice would disclose personal details immedi-
ately, whereas they would be revealed only in
the further step of opening the enclosed space
following the dog’s alert reaction; in practical
terms the same values protected by the
Fourth Amendment are at stake in each case.
The justifications required by the Fourth
Amendment may or may not differ as between
the two practices, but if constitutional scruti-
543 U.S. 415

ILLINOIS v. CABALLES

_Li,It makes sense, then, to treat a sniff
as the search that it amounts to in prac-
tice, and to rely on the body of our Fourth
Amendment cases, including Kyllo, in de-
ciding whether such a search is reasonable.
As a general proposition, using a dog to
sniff for drugs is subject to the rule that
the object of enforcing criminal laws does
not, without more, justify suspicionless
Fourth Amendment intrusions. See In-
dianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. 32, 41-42,
121 S.Ct. 447, 148 L.Ed.2d 333 (2000).
Since the police claim to have had no par-
ticular suspicion that Caballes was violat-
ing any drug law,' this sniff search must
stand or fall on its being ancillary to the
traffic stop that led up to it. It is true
that the police had probable cause to stop
the car for an offense committed in the
officer’s presence, which Caballes concedes
could have justified his arrest. See Brief
for Respondent 31. There is no occasion
to consider authority incident to arrest,
however, see Knowles v. Iowa, 525 U.S.
113, 119 S.Ct. 484, 142 L.Ed.2d 492 (1998),
for the police did nothing more than detain
Caballes long enough to check his record
and write a ticket. As a consequence, the
reasonableness of the search must be as-
sessed in relation to the actual delay the
police chose to impose, and as Justice
GINSBURG points out in her opinion,
post, at 844, the Fourth Amendment con-
sequences of stopping for a traffic citation
are settled law.

_lysin Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S.
420, 439-440, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 82 L.Ed.2d
317 (1984), followed in Knowles, supra, at
117, 119 S.Ct. 484, we held that the ana-

ny is in order for the imager, it is in order for
the dog.

4. Despite the remarkable fact that the police
pulled over a car for going 71 miles an hour
on I-80, the State maintains that excessive
speed was the only reason for the stop, and
the case comes to us on that assumption.

logue of the common traffic stop was the
limited detention for investigation author-
ized by Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct.
1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). While Terry
authorized a restricted incidental search
for weapons when reasonable suspicion
warrants such a safety measure, id., at 25-
26, 88 S.Ct. 1868, the Court took care to
keep a Terry stop from automatically be-
coming a foot in the door for all investiga-
tory purposes; the permissible intrusion
was bounded by the justification for the
detention, id., at 29-30, 88 S.Ct. 1868.
Although facts disclosed by enquiry within
this limit might give grounds to go further,
the government could not otherwise take
advantage of a suspect’s immobility to
search for evidence unrelated to the rea-
son for the detention. That has to be the
rule unless Terry is going to become an
open sesame for general searches, and that
rule requires holding that the police do not
have reasonable grounds to conduct sniff
searches for drugs simply because they
have stopped someone to receive a ticket
for a highway offense. Since the police
had no indication of illegal activity beyond
the speed of the car in this case, the sniff
search should be held unreasonable under
the Fourth Amendment and its fruits
should be suppressed.

Nothing in the case relied upon by the
Court, United States v. Jacobsen, 466 U.S.
109, 104 S.Ct. 1652, 80 L.Ed.2d 85 (1984),
unsettled the limit of reasonable enquiry
adopted in Terry. In Jacobsen, the Court
found that no Fourth Amendment search
occurred when federal agents analyzed

5. Thus, in Place itself, the Government offi-
cials had independent grounds to suspect that
the luggage in question contained contraband
before they employed the dog sniff. 462 U.S.,
at 698, 103 S.Ct. 2637 (describing how Place
had acted suspiciously in line at the airport
and had labeled his luggage with inconsistent
and fictional addresses).

powder they had already lawfully obtained.
The Court noted that because the test
could only reveal whether the powder was
cocaine, the owner had no legitimate priva-
cy interest at stake. 466 U.S., at 123, 104
S.Ct. 1652._]¢As already explained, how-
ever, the use of a sniffing dog in cases like
this is significantly different and properly
treated as a search that does indeed impli-
cate Fourth Amendment protection.

In Jacobsen, once the powder was ana-
lyzed, that was effectively the end of the
matter: either the powder was cocaine, a
fact the owner had no legitimate interest
in concealing, or it was not cocaine, in
which case the test revealed nothing about
the powder or anything else that was not
already legitimately obvious to the police.
But in the case of the dog sniff, the dog
does not smell the disclosed contraband; it
smells a closed container. An affirmative
reaction therefore does not identify a sub-
stance the police already legitimately pos-
sess, but informs the police instead merely
of a reasonable chance of finding contra-
band they have yet to put their hands on.
The police will then open the container and
discover whatever lies within, be it mari-
juana or the owner’s private papers.
Thus, while Jacobsen could rely on the

6. It would also be error to claim that some
variant of the plain-view doctrine excuses the
lack of justification for the dog sniff in this
case. When an officer observes an object left
by its owner in plain view, no search occurs
because the owner has exhibited “no inten-
tion to keep [the object] to himself.” Karz v.
United States, 389 U.S. 347, 361, 88 S.Ct.
507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967) (Harlan, J., con-
curring). In contrast, when an individual
conceals his possessions from the world, he
has grounds to expect some degree of priva-
cy. While plain view may be enhanced
somewhat by technology, see, e.g, Dow
Chemical Co. v. United States, 476 U.S. 227,
106 S.Ct. 1819, 90 L.Ed.2d 226 (1986) (al-
lowing for aerial surveillance of an industrial
complex), there are limits. As Kyllo v. United
States, 533 U.S. 27, 33, 121 S.Ct. 2038, 150
L.Ed.2d 94 (2001), explained in treating the

assumption that the enquiry in question
would either show with certainty that a
known substance was contraband or would
reveal nothing more, both the certainty
and the limit on disclosure that may follow
are missing when the dog sniffs the car.®

_LiThe Court today does not go so far as
to say explicitly that sniff searches by dogs
trained to sense contraband always get a
free pass under the Fourth Amendment,
since it reserves judgment on the constitu-
tional significance of sniffs assumed to be
more intrusive than a dog’s walk around a
stopped car, ante, at 838. For this reason,
I do not take the Court’s reliance on Ja-
cobsen as actually signaling recognition of
a broad authority to conduct suspicionless
sniffs for drugs in any parked car, about
which Justice GINSBURG is rightly con-
cerned, post, at 845-846, or on the person
of any pedestrian minding his own busi-
ness on a sidewalk. But the Court’s stated
reasoning provides no apparent stopping
point short of such excesses. For the sake
of providing a workable framework to ana-
lyze cases on facts like these, which are
certain to come along, I would treat the
dog sniff as the familiar search it is in fact,

thermal-imaging device as outside the plain-
view doctrine, “[w]e have previously reserved
judgment as to how much technological en-
hancement of ordinary perception’ turns
mere observation into a Fourth Amendment
search. While Kyllo laid special emphasis on
the heightened privacy expectations that sur-
round the home, closed car trunks are ac-
corded some level of privacy protection.
See, e.g., New York v. Belton, 453 U.S. 454,
460, n. 4, 101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L-Ed.2d 768
(1981) (holding that even a search incident to
arrest in a vehicle does not itself permit a
search of the trunk). As a result, if Fourth
Amendment protections are to have meaning
in the face of superhuman, yet fallible, tech-
niques like the use of trained dogs, those
techniques must be justified on the basis of
their reasonableness, lest everything be
deemed in plain view.

Amendment.”

Justice GINSBURG, with whom Justice
SOUTER joins, dissenting.

Illinois State Police Trooper Daniel Gil-
lette stopped Roy Caballes for driving 71
miles per hour in a zone with a posted

_lusspeed limit of 65 miles per hour.
Trooper Craig Graham of the Drug Inter-
diction Team heard on the radio that
Trooper Gillette was making a traffic stop.
Although Gillette requested no aid, Gra-
ham decided to come to the scene to con-
duct a dog sniff. Gillette informed Ca-
balles that he was speeding and asked for
the usual documents—driver’s license, car
registration, and proof of insurance. Ca-
balles promptly provided the requested
documents but refused to consent to a
search of his vehicle. After calling his
dispatcher to check on the validity of Ca-
balles’ license and for outstanding war-
rants, Gillette returned to his vehicle to
write Caballes a warning ticket. Inter-
rupted by a radio call on an unrelated
matter, Gillette was still writing the ticket
when Trooper Graham arrived with his
drug-detection dog. Graham walked the
dog around the car, the dog alerted at
Caballes’ trunk, and, after opening the
trunk, the troopers found marijuana. 207

Ill.Dec. 81, 782 N.E.2d 275 (2002), the
court employed a two-part test taken from
Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20
L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), to determine the over-
all reasonableness of the stop. 207 IIl.2d,
at 508, 280 Il.Dec., at 278, 802 N.E.2d, at
204. The court asked first “whether the
officer’s action was justified at its incep-
tion,” and second “whether it was reason-
ably related in scope to the circumstances
which justified the interference in the first
place.” Ibid. (quoting People v. Brownlee,
186 Ill.2d 501, 518-519, 239 Ill.Dec. 25, 34,
713 N.E.2d 556, 565 (1999) (in turn quoting
Terry, 392 U.S., at 19-20, 88 S.Ct. 1868)).
“(I]t is undisputed,” the court observed,
“that the traffic stop was properly initi-
ated”; thus, the dispositive inquiry trained
on the “second part of the Terry test,” in
which “{t]he State bears the burden of
establishing that the conduct remained
within the scope of the stop.” 207 IIl.2d,
at 509, 280 Ill.Dec., at 279, 802 N.E.2d, at
204.

 

_lusThe court concluded that the State
failed to offer sufficient justification for the
canine sniff: “The police did not detect the
odor of marijuana in the car or note any
other evidence suggesting the presence of
illegal drugs.” Ibid. Lacking “specific and
articulable facts” supporting the canine
sniff, ibid. (quoting Cox, 202 Ill.2d, at 470-
471, 270 Ill.Dec. 81, 782 N.E.2d, at 281),
the court ruled, “the police impermissibly
broadened the scope of the traffic stop in
this case into a drug investigation.” 207
Tl.2d, at 509, 280 Ill.Dec., at 279, 802
N.E.2d, at 204.1 I would affirm the Illinois

search depends in part on demonstrated risk.
Unreasonable sniff searches for marijuana are
not necessarily unreasonable sniff searches
for destructive or deadly material if suicide
bombs are a societal risk.

_

. The Illinois Supreme Court held insufficient
to support a canine sniff Gillette’s observa-
tions that (1) Caballes said he was moving to
844

Supreme Court’s judgment and hold that
the drug sniff violated the Fourth Amend-
ment.

In Terry v. Ohio, the Court upheld the
stop and subsequent frisk of an individual
based on an officer’s observation of suspi-
cious behavior and his reasonable belief
that the suspect was armed. See 392 U.S.,
at 27-28, 88 S.Ct. 1868. In a Terry-type
investigatory stop, “the officer’s action
[must be] justified at its inception, and ...
reasonably related in scope to the circum-
stances which justified the interference in
the first place.” Jd., at 20, 88 S.Ct. 1868.
In applying Terry, the Court has several
times indicated that the limitation on
“scope” is not confined to the duration of
the seizure; it also encompasses the man-
ner in which the seizure is conducted.
See, eg. Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist.
Court of Nev. Humboldt Cty. 542 U.S.
177, 188, 124 S.Ct. 2451, 2459, 159 L.Ed.2d
292 (2004) (an officer’s request that an
individual identify himself “has an immedi-
ate relation to the purpose, rationale, and
practical demands of a Terry stop”); Unit-
ed States v. Hensley, 469 U.S. 221, 235, 105
S.Ct. 675, 83 L.Ed.2d 604 (1985) (examin-
ing, under Terry, |oboth “the length and
intrusiveness of the stop and detention”);
Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491, 500, 103

two sport coats in the backseat; (2) the car
smelled of air freshener; (3) Caballes was

and (4) Caballes seemed nervous. Even
viewed together, the court said, these observa-
tions gave rise to “nothing more than a vague
hunch” of “possible wrongdoing.” 207 Ill.2d
504, 509-510, 280 Ill.Dec., at 279-280, 802
N.E.2d 202, 204-205 (2003). This Court pro-
ceeds on “‘the assumption that the officer con-
ducting the dog sniff had no information
about [Caballes]."" Ante, at 837.

gizing a traffic stop to a Terry stop, it did “not

must be temporary and last no longer than
is necessary to effectuate the purpose of
the stop [and] the investigative methods
employed should be the least intrusive
means reasonably available to verify or
dispel the officer’s suspicion ....”).

“A routine traffic stop,” the Court has
observed, “is a relatively brief encounter
and ‘is more analogous to a so-called Terry
stop than to a formal arrest.’”
Knowles v. Iowa, 525 U.S. 118, 117, 119
S.Ct. 484, 142 L.Ed.2d 492 (1998) (quoting
Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 439,
104 S.Ct. 3138, 82 L.Ed.2d 317 (1984)); see
also ante, at 841 (SOUTER, J., dissenting)
(The government may not “take advantage
of a suspect’s immobility to search for
evidence unrelated to the reason for the
detention.”).2- I would apply Terry’s rea-
sonable-relation test, as the Illinois Su-
preme Court did, to determine whether
the canine sniff impermissibly expanded
the scope of the initially valid seizure of
Caballes.

It is hardly dispositive that the dog sniff
in this case may not have lengthened the
duration of the stop. Cf. ante, at 837 (“A
seizure ... can become unlawful if it is
prolonged beyond the time reasonably re-
quired to complete [the initial] mission.”).
Terry, it merits repetition, instructs that

suggest that a traffic stop supported by proba-
ble cause may not exceed the bounds set by
the Fourth Amendment on the scope of a
Terry stop.” 468 U.S., at 439, n. 29, 104 S.Ct.
3138. This Court, however, looked to Terry
earlier in deciding that an officer acted rea-
sonably when he ordered a motorist stopped
for driving with expired license tags to exit
his car, Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U.S. 106,
109-110, 98 S.Ct. 330, 54 L.Ed.2d 331 (1977)
(per curiam), and later reaffirmed the Terry
analogy when evaluating a police officer’s au-
thority to search a vehicle during a routine
traffic stop, Knowles, 525 U.S., at 117, 119
S.Ct. 484.
543 U.S. 422

ILLINOIS v. CABALLES

845

Cite as 125 S.Ct. 834 (2005)

any investigation must be “reasonably re-
lated in scope to the circumstances which
justified the interference in the first
place.” 392 U.S., at 20, 88 S.Ct. 1868
(emphasis added). The unwayfranted,s;
and nonconsensual expansion of the sei-
zure here from a routine traffic stop to a
drug investigation broadened the scope of
the investigation in a manner that, in my
judgment, runs afoul of the Fourth
Amendment.*

The Court rejects the Illinois Supreme
Court’s judgment and, implicitly, the appli-
cation of Terry to a traffic stop converted,
by calling in a dog, to a drug search. The
Court so rules, holding that a dog sniff
does not render a seizure that is reason-
able in time unreasonable in scope. Ante,
at 837. Dog sniffs that detect only the
possession of contraband may be employed
without offense to the Fourth Amendment,
the Court reasons, because they reveal no
lawful activity and hence disturb no legiti-
mate expectation of privacy. Ante, at 837-
838.

In my view, the Court diminishes the
Fourth Amendment’s force by abandoning
the second Terry inquiry (was the police
action “reasonably related in scope to the
circumstances [justifiying] the [initial] in-
terference”). 392 U.S., at 20, 88 S.Ct.
1868. A drug-detection dog is an intimi-
dating animal. Cf. United States v.
Williams, 356 F.3d 1268, 1276 (C.A.10
2004) (McKay, J., dissenting) (“drug dogs
are not lap dogs”). Injecting such an ani-
mal into a routine traffic stop changes the
character of the encounter between the
police and the motorist. The stop becomes
broader, more adversarial, and (in at least
some cases) longer. Caballes—who, as far
as Troopers Gillette and Graham knew,

3. The question whether a police officer inquir-
ing about drugs without reasonable suspicion
unconstitutionally broadens a traffic investi-
gation is not before the Court. Cf. Florida v.

was guilty solely of driving six miles per
hour over the speed limit—was exposed to
the embarrassment and intimidation of be-
ing investigated, on a public thoroughfare,
for drugs. Even if the drug sniff is not
characterized as a Fourth Amendment
“search,” cf. Indianjapolisy,. v. Edmond,
531 U.S. 32, 40, 121 S.Ct. 447, 148 L.Ed.2d
333 (2000); United States v. Place, 462
U.S. 696, 707, 103 S.Ct. 2637, 77 L.Ed.2d
110 (1983), the sniff surely broadened the
scope of the traffic-violation-related sei-
gure.

The Court has never removed police ac-
tion from Fourth Amendment control on
the ground that the action is well calculat-
ed to apprehend the guilty. See, eg.
United States v. Karo, 468 U.S. 705, 717,
104 S.Ct. 3296, 82 L.Ed.2d 530 (1984)
(Fourth Amendment warrant requirement
applies to police monitoring of a beeper in
a house even if “the facts [justify] believing
that a crime is being or will be committed
and that monitoring the beeper wherever
it goes is likely to produce evidence of
criminal activity.”); see also Minnesota v.
Carter, 525 U.S. 83, 110, 119 S.Ct. 469, 142
L.Ed.2d 373 (1998) (GINSBURG, J., dis-
senting) (“Fourth Amendment protection,
reserved for the innocent only, would have
little force in regulating police behavior
toward either the innocent or the guilty.”).
Under today’s decision, every traffic stop
could become an occasion to call in the
dogs, to the distress and embarrassment of
the law-abiding population.

The Illinois Supreme Court, it seems to
me, correctly apprehended the danger in
allowing the police to search for contra-
band despite the absence of cause to sus-
pect its presence. Today’s decision, in
contrast, clears the way for suspicionless,

Bostick, 501 U.S. 429, 434, 111 S.Ct. 2382,
115 L.Ed.2d 389 (1991) (police questioning of
a bus passenger, who might have just said
“No,” did not constitute a seizure).
846

dog-accompanied drug sweeps of parked
cars along sidewalks and in parking lots.
Compare, e.g., United States v. Ludwig, 10
F.3d 1523, 1526-1527 (C.A.10 1993) (up-
holding a search based on a canine drug
sniff of a parked car in a motel parking lot
conducted without particular suspicion),
with United States v. Quinn, 815 F.2d 153,
159 (C.A.1 1987) (officers must have rea-
sonable suspicion that a car contains nar-
cotics at the moment a dog sniff is per-
formed), and Place, 462 U.S., at 706-707,
103 S.Ct. 2637 (Fourth Amendment. not
violated by a dog sniff of a piece of lug-
gage that was seized, pre-sniff, based on
suspicion of drugs). Nor would motorists
have constitutional grounds for complaint
should police with dogs, stationed at long
traffic lights, circle cars waiting for the red
signal to turn green.

_LsToday’s decision also undermines this
Court’s situation-sensitive balancing of
Fourth Amendment interests in other con-
texts. For example, in Bond v. United
States, 529 U.S. 334, 338-339, 120 S.Ct.
1462, 146 L.Ed.2d 365 (2000), the Court

BELL v. CONE

847

Cite as 125 S.Ct. 847 (2005)

This Court has distinguished between
the general interest in crime control and
more immediate threats to public safety.
In Michigan Dept. of State Police v. Sitz,
496 U.S. 444, 110 S.Ct. 2481, 110 L.Ed.2d
412 (1990), this Court upheld the use of a
sobriety traffic checkpoint. Balancing the
State’s interest in preventing drunk driv-
ing, the extent to which that could be
accomplished through the checkpoint pro-
gram, and the degree of intrusion the
stops involved, the Court determined that
the State’s checkpoint program was consis-
tent with the Fourth Amendment. Jd., at
455, 110 S.Ct. 2481. Ten years after Sitz,
in Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. 32,
121 S.Ct. 447, 148 L.Ed.2d 333, this Court
held that a drug interdiction checkpoint
violated the Fourth Amendment. Despite
the illegal narcotics traffic that the Nation
is struggling to stem, the Court explained,
a “general interest in crime control” did
not justify the stops. Id., at 43-44, 121
S.Ct. 447 (internal quotation marks omit-
ted). The Court distinguished the sobriety
checkpoints in Sitz on the ground that
those checkpoints were designed to elimi-
nate an “immediate, vehicle-bound threat
to life and limb.” 531 US., at 43, 121 S.Ct.
447.

The use of bomb-detection dogs to check
vehicles for explosives without doubt has a
closer kinship to the sobriety checkpoints
in Sitz than to the drug checkpoints in
Edmond. As the Court observed in Ed-
mond: “(T]he Fourth Amendment would
almost certainly permit an appropriately
tajlored,; roadblock set up to thwart an
imminent terrorist attack ....” 5381 U.S.,
at 44, 121 S.Ct. 447. Even if the Court
were to change course and characterize a
dog sniff as an independent Fourth
Amendment search, see ante, p. 838
(SOUTER, J., dissenting), the immediate,
present danger of explosives would likely
justify a bomb sniff under the special
needs doctrine. See, ¢g., ante, at 843, n. 7
(SOUTER, J., dissenting); Griffin v. Wis-

consin, 483 U.S. 868, 873, 107 S.Ct. 3164,
97 L.Ed.2d 709 (1987) (permitting excep-
tions to the warrant and probable-cause
requirements for a search when “special
needs, beyond the normal need for law
enforcement,” make those requirements
impracticable (quoting New Jersey v. T.L.
O., 469 U.S. 325, 351, 105 S.Ct. 733, 83
L.Ed.2d 720 (1985) (Blackmun, J., concur-
ring in judgment))).

ek Ok

For the reasons stated, I would hold
that the police violated Caballes’ Fourth
Amendment rights when, without cause to
suspect wrongdoing, they conducted a dog
sniff of his vehicle. I would therefore
affirm the judgment of the Illinois Su-
preme Court.

See 544 US. 944, 125 S.Ct. 1655.
Background: Following affirmance, 665
S.W.2d 87, of his murder convictions and
death sentence, petitioner sought habeas

Phipps McCalla, J., denied petition. Peti-
tioner appealed. The United States Court
of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, 243 F.3d
961, granted relief. State appealed. The
Supreme Court reversed, 535 U.S. 685, 122
S.Ct. 1843, 152 L.Ed.2d 914. On remand,
the Court of Appeals, 359 F.3d 785, again
granted relief. Certiorari was granted.
