In support of its argument, the Court
points to a few passages in congressional
Reports and several statements by various
Members of the 95th Congress to the effect
that the Court in Gilbert had, when it
construed Title VII, misperceived the intent
of the 88th Congress. Ante, at 2628-2629,
n. 17. The Court also points out that
“[m]any of [the Members of the 95th Con-
gress] expressly agreed with the views of
the dissenting Justices.” Ante, at 2628.
Certainly various Members of Congress
said as much. But the fact remains that
Congress as a body has not expressed
these sweeping views in the Pregnancy
Discrimination Act.

Under our decision in General Electric
Co. v. Gilbert, petitioner’s exclusion of
pregnancy benefits for male employees’
spouses would not violate Title VII. Since
nothing in the Pregnancy Discrimination
Act even arguably reaches beyond female
employees affected by pregnancy, Gilbert
requires that we reverse the Court of Ap-
peals. Because the Court concludes other-
wise, I dissent.

UNITED STATES, Petitioner
v.

Raymond J. PLACE.
No. 81-1617.

Argued March 2, 1983.
Decided June 20, 1983.

Defendant was convicted in the United
States District Court for the Eastern Dis-
trict of New York, 498 F.Supp. 1217, of
possession of narcotics and he appealed.
The Court of Appeals for the Second Cir-
cuit, reversed, 660 F.2d 44. The Supreme
Court, Justice O’Connor, held that: (1) in-
vestigative detention of a traveler’s lug-
gage is permissible on less than probable

cause under Terry principles; (2) exposure
of luggage to a trained narcotics detection
dog is not a search for Fourth Amendment
purposes; but (3) 90-minute detention of
defendant’s luggage was unreasonable,
and the violation of Fourth Amendment
rights was exacerbated by agent’s failure
to tell defendant where they were taking
the luggage, how long they would keep it,
and how they would return it to him.
Affirmed.

Justice Brennan filed an opinion con-
curring in the result in which Justice Mar-
shall joined.

Justice Blackmun filed an opinion con-
curring in the judgment in which Justice
Marshall joined.

1. Searches and Seizures €7(5)
Ordinarily, seizure of personal proper-
ty is per se unreasonable within the mean-
ing of the Fourth Amendment unless it is
accomplished pursuant to a judicial war-
rant which is issued upon probable cause
and which particularly describe the items
to be seized. U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 4:

2. Searches and Seizures 7(1)

Where law enforcement authorities
have probable cause to believe that contain-
er holds contraband or evidence of a crime
but have not secured a warrant, Fourth
Amendment permits seizure of the proper-
ty, pending issuance of a warrant to exam-
ine its contents, if the exigencies of the
circumstances demand it or some other rec-
ognized exception to the warrant require-
ment is present. U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 4.

3. Searches and Seizures 3.3(1)

Terry principles are applicable to per-
mit investigative seizures of personal prop-
erty on the basis of reasonable, articulable
suspicion, premised on objective facts, that
the luggage contains contraband or evi-
dence of a crime.

4. Searches and Seizures 7(1)

In applying Terry principles to investi-
gative detention of luggage, court must
balance the nature and quality of intrusion
2638

on the individual’s Fourth Amendment in-
terests against the importance of the gov-
ernmental interest alleged to justify the
intrusion. U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 4.

5. Drugs and Narcotics ¢-184

Where authorities possess specific and
articulable facts warranting a reasonable
belief that a traveler’s luggage contains
narcotics, governmental interest in seizing
the luggage briefly to pursue further in-
vestigation is substantial and justifies the
limited intrusion.

6. Searches and Seizures €7(1)

Context of a particular law enforce-
ment practice may affect the determination
of whether a brief intrusion on Fourth
Amendment interests on less than probable
cause is essential to effective criminal in-
vestigation and thus whether it is permissi-
ble. U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 4.

7. Searches and Seizures 3.1

When an officer's observations lead
him reasonably to believe that a traveler is
carrying luggage which contains narcotics,
Terry principles permit the officer to de-
tain the luggage briefly to investigate
those circumstances which arouse his sus-
picion, provided the investigative detention
is properly limited in scope.

8. Searches and Seizures 1

Exposure of traveler’s luggage, which
was located in a public place, to a trained
narcotics detection dog for sniffing pur-
poses did not constitute a “search” for
Fourth Amendment purposes. U.S.C.A.
Const.Amend. 4.

9. Searches and Seizures 1

Agents made a seizure of traveler’s
luggage for purposes of the Fourth
Amendment when, following his refusal to
consent to a search, a government agent
told the traveler that he was going to take
the luggage to a federal judge to secure
the issuance of a search warrant. U.S.C.A.
Const.Amend. 4.

10. Searches and Seizures 3.3

When police seize luggage from a sus-
pect’s custody, limitations applicable to in-
vestigative detentions of the person define
the permissible scope of the investigative
detention of the person’s luggage on less
than probable cause.

11. Searches and Seizures €=7(1)

Detention for 90 minutes of defend-
ant’s luggage demonstrated that the sei-
zure was unreasonable in the absence of
probable cause and could not be justified
on Terry principles.

12. Searches and Seizures €7(1)
Although 90-minute detention of de-
fendant’s luggage was sufficient to render
seizure unreasonable in the absence of
probable cause, violation of defendant’s
Fourth Amendment rights was exacerbated
by failure of government agents to accu-
rately inform the defendant of the place to
which they were transporting the luggage,
the length of time he might be dispos-
sessed of the luggage, and what arrange-
ments would be made for the return of the
luggage if the investigation dispelled their
suspicions. U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 4.

Syllabus *

When respondent’s behavior aroused
the suspicion of law enforcement officers
as he waited in line at the Miami Interna-
tional Airport to purchase a ticket to New
York’s La Guardia Airport, the officers ap-
proached respondent and requested and re-
ceived identification. Respondent consent-
ed to a search of the two suitcases he had
checked, but because his flight was about
to depart the officers decided not to search
the luggage. The officers then found some
discrepancies in the address tags on the
luggage and called Drug Enforcement Ad-
ministration (DEA) authorities in New
York to relay this information. Upon re-
spondent’s arrival at La Guardia Airport,
two DEA agents approached him, said that

they believed he might be carrying narcot-
ics, and asked for and received identifica-
tion. When respondent refused to consent
to a search of his luggage, one of the
agents told him that they were going to
take it to a federal judge to obtain a search
warrant. The agents then took the lug-
gage to Kennedy Airport where it was
subjected to a “sniff test” by a trained
narcotics detection dog which reacted posi-
tively to one of the suitcases. At this
point, 90 minutes had elapsed since the
seizure of the luggage. Thereafter, the
agents obtained a search warrant for that
suitcase and upon opening it discovered
cocaine. Respondent was indicted for pos-
session of cocaine with intent to distribute,
and the District Court denied his motion to
suppress the contents of the suitcase. He
pleaded guilty to the charge and was con-
victed, but reserved the right to appeal the
denial of his motion to suppress. The
Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the
prolonged seizure of respondent’s luggage
exceeded the limits of the type of investiga-
tive stop permitted by Terry v. Ohio, 392
US. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, and
hence amounted to a seizure without proba-
ble cause in violation of the Fourth Amend-
ment.

Held: Under the circumstances, the
seizure of respondent’s luggage violated
the Fourth Amendment. Accordingly, the
evidence obtained from the subsequent
search of the luggage was inadmissible,
and respondent’s conviction must be re-
versed. Pp. 2641-2646.

(a) When an officer’s observations lead
him reasonably to believe that a traveler is
carrying luggage that contains narcotics,
the principles of Terry and its progeny
permit the officer to detain the luggage
temporarily to investigate the circumstanc-
es that aroused the officer’s suspicion, |pro-
vided that the investigative detention is
properly limited in scope. Pp. 2641-2644.

(b) The investigative procedure of sub-
jecting luggage to a “sniff test” by a well-
trained narcotics detection dog does not
constitute a “search” within the meaning
of the Fourth Amendment. Pp. 2644-2645.

(c) When the police seize luggage from
the suspect’s custody, the limitations appli-
cable to investigative detentions of the per-
son should define the permissible scope of
an investigative detention of the luggage
on less than probable cause. Under this
standard, the police conduct here exceeded
the permissible limits of a Terry-type inves-
tigative stop. The length of the detention
of respondent’s luggage alone precludes
the conclusion that the seizure was reason-
able in the absence of probable cause.
This Fourth Amendment violation was ex-
acerbated by the DEA agents’ failure to
inform respondent accurately of the place
to which they were transporting his lug-
gage, of the length of time he might be
dispossessed, and of what arrangements
would be made for return of the luggage if
the investigation dispelled the suspicion.
Pp. 2645-2646.

660 F.2d 44 (2 Cir.1981), affirmed.

Alan I. Horowitz, Washington, D.C., for
petitioner.

James Dexter Clark, Fort Lauderdale,
Fla., for respondent.

Justice O'CONNOR delivered the opinion
of the Court.

This case presents the issue whether the
Fourth Amendment prohibits law enforce-
ment authorities from temporarily jdetain-
ing personal luggage for exposure to a
trained narcotics detection dog on the basis
of reasonable suspicion that the luggage
contains narcotics. Given the enforcement
problems associated with the detection of
narcotics trafficking and the minimal intru-
sion that a properly limited detention would
entail, we conclude that the Fourth Amend-
ment does not prohibit such a detention.
On the facts of this case, however, we hold
that the police conduct exceeded the
bounds of a permissible investigative deten-
tion of the luggage.

I

Respondent Raymond J. Place’s behavior
aroused the suspicions of law enforcement

[698
2640

officers as he waited in line at the Miami
International Airport to purchase a ticket
to New York’s La Guardia Airport. As
Place proceeded to the gate for his flight,
the agents approached him and requested
his airline ticket and some identification.
Place complied with the request and con-
sented to a search of the two suitcases he
had checked. Because his flight was about
to depart, however, the agents decided not
to search the luggage.

Prompted by Place’s parting remark that
he had recognized that they were police,
the agents inspected the address tags on
the checked luggage and noted discrepan-
cies in the two street addresses. Further
investigation revealed that neither address
existed and that the telephone number
Place had given the airline belonged to a
third address on the same street. On the
basis of their encounter with Place and this
information, the Miami agents called Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) author-
ities in New York to relay their information
about Place.

Two DEA agents waited for Place at the
arrival gate at La Guardia Airport in New
York. There again, his behavior aroused
the suspicion of the agents. After he had
claimed his two bags and called a limou-
sine, the agents decided to approach him.
They identified themselves as federal nar-
cotics agents, to which Place responded
that he knew they were “cops” and had
spotted them as soon as he had deplaned.

_is99 _jOne of the agents informed Place that,

based on their own observations and infor-
mation obtained from the Miami authori-
ties, they believed that he might be carry-
ing narcotics. After identifying the bags
as belonging to him, Place stated that a

1. In support of his motion, respondent also con-
tended that the detention of his person at both
the Miami and La Guardia Airports was not
based on reasonable suspicion and that the
“sniff test” of his luggage was conducted in a
manner that tainted the dog’s reaction. 498
F.Supp. 1217, 1221, 1228 (EDNY 1980). The
District Court rejected both contentions. As to
the former, it concluded that the agents had
reasonable suspicion to believe that Place was
engaged in criminal activity when he was de-

number of police at the Miami Airport had
surrounded him and searched his baggage.
The agents responded that their informa-
tion was to the contrary. The agents re-
quested and received identification from
Place—a New Jersey driver’s license, on
which the agents later ran a computer
check that disclosed no offenses, and his
airline ticket receipt. When Place refused
to consent to a search of his luggage, one
of the agents told him that they were going
to take the luggage to a federal judge to
try to obtain a search warrant and that
Place was free to accompany them. Place
declined, but obtained from one of the
agents telephone numbers at which the
agents could be reached.

The agents then took the bags to Kenne-
dy Airport, where they subjected the bags
to a “sniff test” by a trained narcotics
detection dog. The dog reacted positively
to the smaller of the two bags but ambigu-
ously to the larger bag. Approximately 90
minutes had elapsed since the seizure of
respondent’s luggage. Because it was late
on a Friday afternoon, the agents retained
the luggage until Monday morning, when
they secured a search warrant from a Mag-
istrate for the smaller bag. Upon opening
that bag, the agents discovered 1,125
grams of cocaine.

Place was indicted for possession of co-
caine with intent to distribute in violation
of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1). In the District
Court, Place moved to suppress the con-
tents of the luggage seized from him at
LaGuardia Airport, claiming that the war-
rantless seizure of the luggage violated his
Fourth Amendment rights.! The District

Court denied the motion. Applying the _j700

standard of Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88

tained at the two airports and that the stops
were therefore lawful. Jd. at 1225, 1226. On
appeal, the Court of Appeals did not reach this
issue, assuming the existence of reasonable sus-
picion. Respondent Place cross-petitioned in
this Court on the issue of reasonable suspicion,
and we denied certiorari. Place v. United
States, 457 U.S. 1106, 102 S.Ct. 2905, 73 L.Ed.2d
1314 (1982). We therefore have no occasion to
address the issue here.

S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), to the
detention of personal property, it concluded
that detention of the bags could be justified
if based on reasonable suspicion to believe
that the bags contained narcotics. Finding
reasonable suspicion, the District Court
held that Place’s Fourth Amendment rights
were not violated by seizure of the bags by
the DEA agents. 498 F.Supp. 1217, 1228
(EDNY 1980). Place pleaded guilty to the
possession charge, reserving the right to
appeal the denial of his motion to suppress.

On appeal of the conviction, the United
States Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit reversed. 660 F.2d 44 (1981). The
majority assumed both that Terry princi-
ples could be applied to justify a warrant-
less seizure of baggage on less than proba-
ble cause and that reasonable suspicion ex-
isted to justify the investigatory stop of
Place. The majority concluded, however,
that the prolonged seizure of Place’s bag-
gage exceeded the permissible limits of a
Terry -type investigative stop and conse-
quently amounted to a seizure without
probable cause in violation of the Fourth
Amendment.

We granted certiorari, 457 U.S. 1104, 102
S.Ct. 2901, 78 L.Ed.2d 1812 (1982), and now
affirm.

II

[1,2] The Fourth Amendment protects
the “right of the people to be secure in
their persons, houses, papers, and effects,
against unreasonable searches and sei-
zures.” (Emphasis added.) Although in
the context of personal property, and par-
ticularly containers, the Fourth Amend-

2. The Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment
provides that “no Warrants shall issue, but upon
probable cause, supported by Oath or affirma-
tion, and particularly describing the place to be
searched, and the persons or things to be
seized.”

3. In Sanders, the Court explained:

“The police acted properly—indeed commend-
ably—in apprehending respondent and his lug-
gage. They had ample probable cause to be-
lieve that respondent's green suitcase contained
marihuana.... Having probable cause to be-
lieve that contraband was being driven away in

ment challenge is jtypically to the subse- 01

quent search of the container rather than
to its initial seizure by the authorities, our
cases reveal some general principles re-
garding seizures. In the ordinary case, the
Court has viewed a seizure of personal
property as per se unreasonable within the
meaning of the Fourth Amendment unless
it is accomplished pursuant to a judicial
warrant issued upon probable cause and
particularly describing the items to be
seized.2? See, eg. Marron v. United
States, 275 U.S. 192, 196, 48 S.Ct. 74, 76, 72
L.Ed. 231 (1927). Where law enforcement
authorities have probable cause to believe
that a container holds contraband or evi-
dence of a crime, but have not secured a
warrant, the Court has interpreted the
Amendment to permit seizure of the prop-
erty, pending issuance of a warrant to ex-
amine its contents, if the exigencies of the
circumstances demand it or some other rec-
ognized exception to the warrant require-
ment is present. See, eg., Arkansas v.
Sanders, 442 U.S. 758, 761, 99 S.Ct. 2586,
2591, 61 L.Ed.2d 285 (1979); United States
v. Chadwick, 433 U.S. 1, 97 S.Ct. 2476, 58
L.Ed.2d 538 (1977); Coolidge v. New
Hampshire, 403 U.S. 448, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29
L.Ed.2d 564 (1971).3 For example, “objects
such as weapons or contraband found in a
public place may be seized by the police
without a warrant,” Payton v. New York,
445 U.S. 578, 587, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 1380, 63
L.Ed.2d 689 (1980), because, under these
circumstances, the risk of the item’s disap-
pearance or use for its intended purpose

before a_jwarrant may be obtained out- _[702

weighs the interest in possession. See also

the taxi, the police were justified in stopping the
vehicle ... and seizing the suitcase they suspect-
ed contained contraband.” 442 U.S., at 761, 99
S.Ct., at 2591.

The Court went on to hold that the police violat-
ed the Fourth Amendment in immediately
searching the luggage rather than first obtaining
a warrant authorizing the search. Jd., at 766, 99
S.Ct., at 2594. That holding was not affected by
our recent decision in United States v. Ross, 456
U.S. 798, 824, 102 S.Ct. 2157, 2172, 72 L.Ed.2d
572 (1982).

[3] In this case, the Government asks
us to recognize the reasonableness under
the Fourth Amendment of warrantless sei-
zures of personal luggage from the custo-
dy of the owner on the basis of less than
probable cause, for the purpose of pursu-
ing a limited course of investigation, short
of opening the luggage, that would quickly
confirm or dispel the authorities’ suspicion.
Specifically, we are asked to apply the prin-
ciples of Terry v. Ohio, supra, to permit
such seizures on the basis of reasonable,
articulable suspicion, premised on objective
facts, that the luggage contains contraband
or evidence of a crime. In our view, such
application is appropriate.

In Terry the Court first recognized “the
narrow authority of police officers who
suspect criminal activity to make limited
intrusions on an individual’s personal se-
curity based on less than probable cause.”
Michigan v. Summers, 452 U.S. 692, 698,
101 S.Ct. 2587, 2591, 69 L.Ed.2d 340 (1981).
In approving the limited search for weap-
ons, or “frisk,” of an individual the police
reasonably believed to be armed and dan-
gerous, the Court implicitly acknowledged
the authority of the police to make a fore-
ible stop of a person when the officer has
reasonable, articulable suspicion that the
person has been, is, or is about to be en-
gaged in criminal activity. 392 U.S., at 22,
88 S.Ct., at 1880.4 That implicit proposition
was embraced openly in Adams v. Wil-
liams, 407 U.S. 148, 146, 92 S.Ct. 1921,
1928, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972), where the
Court relied on Terry to hold that the po-
lice officer lawfully made a forcible stop of
the suspect to investigate an informant’s
tip that the suspect was carrying narcotics
and a concealed weapon. See also Michi-
gan v. Summers, supra (limited detention

4. In his concurring opinion in Terry, Justice

Harlan made this logical underpinning of the

Court's Fourth Amendment holding clear:

“In the first place, if the frisk is justified in

order to protect the officer during an encounter
with a citizen, the officer must first have consti-

ises pursuant to valid search warrant);
United States v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 101
S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981) (stop near
border of vehicle suspected of transporting
illegal aliens); United States v. Brignoni-
Ponce, 422 U.S. 878, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45
L.Ed.2d 607 (1975) (brief investigative stop
near border for questioning about citizen-
ship and immigration status).

[4] The exception to the probable-cause
requirement for limited seizures of the per-
son recognized in Terry and its progeny
rests on a balancing of the competing inter-
ests to determine the reasonableness of the
type of seizure involved within the meaning
of “the Fourth Amendment’s general pro-
scription against unreasonable searches
and seizures.” 392 U.S., at 20, 88 S.Ct., at
1879. We must balance the nature and
quality of the intrusion on the individual’s
Fourth Amendment interests against the
importance of the governmental interests
alleged to justify the intrusion. When the
nature and extent of the detention are mini-
mally intrusive of the individual’s Fourth
Amendment interests, the opposing law en-
forcement interests can support a seizure
based on less than probable cause.

[5] We examine first the governmental
interest offered as a justification for a
brief seizure of luggage from the suspect’s
custody for the purpose of pursuing a limit-
ed course of investigation. The Govern-
ment contends that, where the authorities
possess specific and articulable facts war-
ranting a reasonable belief that a traveler’s
luggage contains narcotics, the governmen-
tal interest in seizing the luggage briefly to
pursue further investigation is substantial.
We agree. As observed in United States
v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544, 561, 100 S.Ct.
1870, 1880, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980) (opinion
of POWELL, J.), “[{t]he public has a com-
pelling interest in detecting those who

tutional grounds to insist on an encounter, to

make a forcible stop.... I would make it per-
fectly clear that the right to frisk in this case
depends upon the reasonableness of a forcible

stop to investigate a suspected crime.” 392 U.S.,
at 32-33, 88 S.Ct., at 1885-1886.

would traffic in deadly drugs for personal
profit.”

[6] Respondent suggests that, absent
some special law enforcement interest such
as officer safety, a generalized interest in
law enforcement cannot justify an intru-
sion on an individual’s Fourth Amendment
interests in the absence of yprobable cause.
Our prior cases, however, do not support
this proposition. In Terry, we described
the governmental interests supporting the
initial seizure of the person as “effective
crime prevention and detection; it is this
interest which underlies the recognition
that a police officer may in appropriate
circumstances and in an appropriate man-
ner approach a person for purposes of in-
vestigating possibly criminal behavior even
though there is no probable cause to make
an arrest.” 392 US., at 22, 88 S.Ct. at
1880. Similarly, in Michigan v. Summers
we identified three law enforcement inter-
ests that justified limited detention of the
occupants of the premises during execution
of a valid search warrant: “preventing
flight in the event that incriminating evi-
dence is found,” “minimizing the risk of
harm” both to the officers and the occu-
pants, and “orderly completion of the
search.” 452 U.S., at 702-703, 101 S.Ct., at
2594. Cf. Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491,
500, 108 S.Ct. 1319, 1825, 75 L.Ed.2d 229
(1983) (plurality opinion) (“The predicate
permitting seizures on suspicion short of
probable cause is that law enforcement in-
terests warrant a limited intrusion on the
personal security of the suspect”). The
test is whether those interests are suffi-
ciently “substantial,” 452 U.S., at 699, 101
S8.Ct., at 2592, not whether they are inde-
pendent of the interest in investigating

5. Referring to the problem of intercepting drug
couriers in the Nation's airports, Justice POW-
ELL has observed:

“Much of the drug traffic is highly organized
and conducted by sophisticated criminal syndi-
cates. The profits are enormous. And many
drugs ... may be easily concealed. As a result,
the obstacles to detection of illegal conduct may
be unmatched in any other area of law enforce-
ment.” United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S.

crimes effectively and apprehending sus-
pects. The context of a particular law en-
forcement practice, of course, may affect
the determination whether a brief intrusion
on Fourth Amendment interests on less
than probable cause is essential to effective
criminal investigation. Because of the in-
herently transient nature of drug courier
activity at airports, allowing police to make
brief investigative stops of persons at air-
ports on reasonable suspicion of drug-traf-
ficking substantially enhances the likeli-
hood that police will be able to prevent the
flow of narcotics into distribution chan-
nels.5

_jAgainst this strong governmental inter- _1705

est, we must weigh the nature and extent
of the intrusion upon the _individual’s
Fourth Amendment rights when the police
briefly detain luggage for limited investiga-
tive purposes. On this point, respondent
Place urges that the rationale for a Terry
stop of the person is wholly inapplicable to
investigative detentions of personalty.
Specifically, the Terry exception to the
probable-cause requirement is premised on
the notion that a Terry-type stop of the
person is substantially less intrusive of a
person’s liberty interests than a formal ar-
rest. In the property context, however,
Place urges, there are no degrees of intru-
sion. Once the owner’s property is seized,
the dispossession is absolute.

We disagree. The intrusion on possesso-
ry interests occasioned by a seizure of
one’s personal effects can vary both in its
nature and extent. The seizure may be
made after the owner has relinquished con-
trol of the property to a third party or, as
here, from the immediate custody and con-
trol of the owner. Moreover, the police

may confine their investigation to an on-
the-spot inquiry—for example, immediate
exposure of the luggage to a trained nar-
cotics detection dog’—or transport the
property to another location. Given the
fact that seizures of property can vary in
intrusiveness, some brief detentions of per-
sonal effects may be so minimally intrusive
of Fourth Amendment interests that strong
countervailing governmental interests will
justify a seizure based only on specific
articulable facts that the property contains
contraband or evidence of a crime.

[7] In sum, we conclude that when an
officer’s observations lead him reasonably
to believe that a traveler is carrying lug-
gage that contains narcotics, the principles
of Terry and its progeny would permit the
officer to detain the luggage briefly to
investigate the circumstances that aroused
his suspicion, provided that the investiga-
tive detention is properly limited in scope.

The purpose for which respondent’s lug-
gage was seized, of course, was to arrange
its exposure to a narcotics detection dog.
Obviously, if this investigative procedure is
itself a search requiring probable cause,
the initial seizure of respondent’s luggage
for the purpose of subjecting it to the sniff
test—no matter how brief—could not be
justified on less than probable cause. See
Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S., at 20, 88 S.Ct., at
1879; United States v. Cortez, 449 US., at
421, 101 S.Ct., at 697; United States v.

There the defendant had voluntarily relin-
quished two packages of coins to the postal
authorities. Several facts aroused the suspicion
of the postal officials, who detained the pack-
ages, without searching them, for about 29
hours while certain lines of inquiry were pur-
sued. The information obtained during this
time was sufficient to give the authorities proba-
ble cause to believe that the packages contained
counterfeit coins. After obtaining a warrant,
the authorities opened the packages, found
counterfeit coins therein, resealed the packages,
and sent them on their way. Expressly limiting
its holding to the facts of the case, the Court
concluded that the 29-hour detention of the
packages on reasonable suspicion that they con-
tained contraband did not violate the Fourth
Amendment. Id., at 253, 90 S.Ct., at 1032.

US., at 146, 92 S.Ct., at 1923.

The Fourth Amendment “protects people
from unreasonable government intrusions

into their legitimate expectationsjof priva- {707

cy.” United States v. Chadwick, 433 US.,
at 7, 97 S.Ct., at 2481. We have affirmed
that a person possesses a privacy interest
in the contents of personal luggage that is
protected by the Fourth Amendment. Id.,
at 18, 97 S.Ct., at 2484. A “canine sniff”
by a well-trained narcotics detection dog,
however, does not require opening the lug-
gage. It does not expose noncontraband
items that otherwise would remain hidden
from public view, as does, for example, an
officer’s rummaging through the contents
of the luggage. Thus, the manner in which
information is obtained through this inves-
tigative technique is much less intrusive
than a typical search. Moreover, the sniff
discloses only the presence or absence of
narcotics, a contraband item. Thus, de-
spite the fact that the sniff tells the author-
ities something about the contents of the
luggage, the information obtained is limit-
ed. This limited disclosure also ensures
that the owner of the property is not sub-
jected to the embarrassment and inconven-
ience entailed in less discriminate and more
intrusive investigative methods.

[8] In these respects, the canine sniff is
sui generis. We are aware of no other
investigative procedure that is so limited
both in the manner in which the informa-
tion is obtained and in the content of the

As one commentator has noted, “Van Leeu-
wen was an easy case for the Court because the
defendant was unable to show that the invasion
intruded upon either a privacy interest in the
contents of the packages or a possessory interest
in the packages themselves.” 3 W. LaFave,

ed).

information revealed by the procedure.
Therefore, we conclude that the particular
course of investigation that the agents in-
tended to pursue here—exposure of respon-
dent’s luggage, which was located in a
public place, to a trained canine—did not
constitute a “search” within the meaning
of the Fourth Amendment.

Ill

[9] There is no doubt that the agents
made a “seizure” of Place’s luggage for
purposes of the Fourth Amendment when,
following his refusal to consent to a search,
the agent told Place that he was going to
take the luggage to a federal judge to
secure issuance of a warrant. As we ob-
served in Terry, “(t]he manner in which the
seizure ... [was] conducted is, of course,
as vital a part of the inquiry as whether [it
was] warranted at all.” 392 U.S., at 28, 88
S.Ct., at 1888. We therefore examine
whether the agents’ conduct in this case
was such as to place the seizure within the
general rule requiring probable cause for a
seizure or within Terry’s exception to that
rule.

[10] At the outset, we must reject the
Government’s suggestion that the point at
which probable cause for seizure of lug-
gage from the person’s presence becomes
necessary is more distant than in the case
of a Terry stop of the person himself. The
premise of the Government’s argument is
that seizures of property are generally less
intrusive than seizures of the person.
While true in some circumstances, that
premise is faulty on the facts we address in
this case. The precise type of detention we
confront here is seizure of personal lug-
gage from the immediate possession of the
suspect for the purpose of arranging expo-
sure to a narcotics detection dog. Particu-
larly in the case of detention of luggage
within the traveler’s immediate possession,
the police conduct intrudes on both the
8. “At least when the authorities do not make it

absolutely clear how they plan to reunite the

suspect and his possessions at some future time

and place, seizure of the object is tantamount to
seizure of the person. This is because that per-

suspect’s possessory interest in his lug-
gage as well as his liberty interest in pro-
ceeding with his itinerary. The person
whose luggage is detained is technically
still free to continue his travels or carry
out other personal activities pending re-
lease of the luggage. Moreover, he is not
subjected to the coercive atmosphere of a
custodial confinement or to the public in-
dignity of being personally detained.
Nevertheless, such a seizure can effective-
ly restrain the person since he is subjected
to the possible disruption of his travel
plans in order to remain with his luggage
or to arrange for its return.’ Therefore,
when the police seize luggage from the

_lsuspect’s custody, we think the limitations
applicable to investigative detentions of the
person should define the permissible scope
of an investigative detention of the per-
son’s luggage on less than probable cause.
Under this standard, it is clear that the
police conduct here exceeded the permissi-
ble limits of a Terry -type investigative
stop.

{11] The length of the detention of re-
spondent’s luggage alone precludes the
conclusion that the seizure was reasonable
in the absence of probable cause. Al-
though we have recognized the reasonable-
ness of seizures longer than the momenta-
ry ones involved in Terry, Adams, and
Brignoni-Ponce, see Michigan v. Sum-
mers, 452 U.S. 692, 101 S.Ct. 2587, 69
L.Ed.2d 340 (1981), the brevity of the inva-
sion of the individual’s Fourth Amendment
interests is an important factor in deter-
mining whether the seizure is so minimally
intrusive as to be justifiable on reasonable
suspicion. Moreover, in assessing the ef-
fect of the length of the detention, we take
into account whether the police diligently
pursue their investigation. We note that
here the New York agents knew the time
of Place’s scheduled arrival at La Guardia,

son must either remain on the scene or else
seemingly surrender his effects permanently to
the police.” 3 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure
§ 9.6, p. 72 (Supp.1982).

had ample time to arrange for their addi-
tional investigation at that location, and
thereby could have minimized the intrusion
on respondent’s Fourth Amendment inter-
ests.? Thus, although we decline to adopt
any outside time limitation for a permissi-
ble Terry stop," we have never approved a
seizure of the person for the prolonged
90-minute period involved here and cannot
do so on the facts presented by this case.
See Dunaway v. New York, 442 U.S. 200,
99 S.Ct. 2248, 60 L.Ed.2d 824 (1979).

[12] Although the 90-minute detention
of respondent’s luggage is sufficient to
render the seizure unreasonable, the viola-
tion was exacerbated by the failure of the
agents to accurately inform respondent of
the place to which they were transporting
his luggage, of the length of time he might
be dispossessed, and of what arrangements
would be made for return of the luggage if
the investigation dispelled the suspicion.
In short, we hold that the detention of
respondent’s luggage in this case went be-
yond the narrow authority possessed by
police to detain briefly luggage reasonably
suspected to contain narcotics.

IV

We conclude that, under all of the cir-
cumstances of this case, the seizure of re-
spondent’s luggage was unreasonable un-
der the Fourth Amendment. Consequent-
ly, the evidence obtained from the subse-
quent search of his luggage was inadmissi-
ble, and Place’s conviction must be re-
versed. The judgment of the Court of Ap-
peals, accordingly, is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

9. Cf. Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S., at 506, 103 S.Ct.,
at 1329 (plurality opinion) (“If [trained narcot-
ics detection dogs] had been used, Royer and
his luggage could have been momentarily de-
tained while this investigative procedure was
carried out”). This course of conduct also
would have avoided the further substantial in-
trusion on respondent's possessory interests
caused by the removal of his luggage to another
location.

Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice
MARSHALL joins, concurring in the re-
sult.

In this case, the Court of Appeals as-
sumed both that the officers had the “rea-
sonable suspicion” necessary to justify an
“investigative” stop of respondent under
Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20
L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), and its progeny, and
that the principles of Terry apply to sei-
zures of property. See 660 F.2d 44, 50
(CA2 1981); ante, at 2641. The court held
simply that “the prolonged seizure of [re-
spondent’s] baggage went far beyond a
mere investigative stop and amounted to a
violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.”

660 F.2d, at 50. See also id. jat 52, 58. Tyan

would affirm the Court of Appeals’ judg-
ment on this ground.

Instead of simply affirming on this
ground and putting an end to the matter,
the Court decides to reach, and purportedly
to resolve, the constitutionality of the sei-
zure of respondent’s luggage on less than
probable cause and the exposure of that
luggage to a narcotics detection dog. See
ante, at 2644. Apparently, the Court finds
itself unable to “resist the pull to decide
the constitutional issues involved in this
case on a broader basis than the record
before [it] imperatively requires.” Street
v. New York, 394 U.S. 576, 581, 89 S.Ct.

concur only in the result.

forcement authorities with a clear rule to guide
their conduct. Nevertheless, we question the
wisdom of a rigid time limitation. Such a limit
would undermine the equally important need to
allow authorities to graduate their responses to

able cause requirement created by Terry
and its progeny. See Florida v. Royer,
460 U.S. 491, 509, 108 S.Ct. 1819, 1830, 75
L.Ed.2d 229 (1983) (BRENNAN, J., concur-

L.Ed.2d 908 (1988) (BRENNAN, J., concur-
ring). Unfortunately, the unwarranted ex-
pansion of that exception which the Court
endorses today forces me to elaborate on
my previously expressed views.

In Terry the Court expressly declined to
address “the constitutional propriety of an
investigative ‘seizure’ upon less than proba-
ble cause for purposes of ‘detention’ and/or
interrogation.” 392 U.S., at 19, n. 16, 88
S.Ct., at 1879, n. 16.1 The Court was
confronted with “the quite narrow ques-
tion” of “whether it is always unreasonable
for a policeman to seize a person and sub-
ject him to a limited search for weapons
unless there is probable cause for an ar-
rest.” Id., at 15, 88 S.Ct. at 1876. In
addressing this question, the Court noted
that it was dealing “with an entire rubric
of police conduct—necessarily swift action
predicated upon the on-the-spot observa-
tions of the officer on the beat—which
historically has not been, and as a practical
matter could not be, subjected to the war-
rant procedure.” Jd., at 20, 88 S.Ct, at
1879. As a result, the conduct involved in
the case had to be “tested by the Fourth
Amendment’s general proscription against
unreasonable searches and _ seizures.”
Ibid. (footnote omitted). The Court’s in-
quiry into the “reasonableness” of the con-
duct at issue was based on a “ ‘balancing
[of] the need to search [or seize] against
the invasion which the search [or seizure]
entails.’” Jd., at 21, 88 S.Ct., at 1879,
quoting Camara v. Municipal Court, 387

1. The “seizure” at issue in Terry v. Ohio, was the
actual physical restraint imposed on the suspect.
392 U.S., at 19, 88 S.Ct., at 1879. The Court
assumed that the officer's initial approach and
questioning of the suspect did not amount to a
“seizure.” Id., at 19, n. 16, 88 S.Ct., at 1879, n.
16. The Court acknowledged, however, that
“seizures” may occur irrespective of the imposi-
tion of actual physical restraint. The Court
stated that “[i]t must be recognized that whenev-
er a police officer accosts an individual and

U.S. 528, 5387, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 1735, 18
L.Ed.2d 980 (1967). The Court concluded
that the officer’s conduct was reasonable
and stated its holding as follows:
“We merely hold today that where a
police officer observes unusual conduct
which leads him reasonably to conclude
in light of his experience that criminal
activity may be afoot and that the per-
sons with whom he is dealing may be
armed and presently dangerous, where in
the course of investigating this behavior
he identifies himself as a policeman and
makes reasonable inquiries, and where
nothing in the initial stages of the en-
counter serves to dispel his reasonable
fear for his own or others’ safety, he is
entitled for the protection of himself and
others in the area to conduct a carefully

limited search of_jthe outer clothing of jis

such persons in an attempt to discover
weapons which might be used to assault
him.” 392 U.S., at 30, 88 S.Ct., at 1884.

In Adams v. Williams, 407 U.S. 143, 92
S.Ct. 1921, 82 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972), the Court
relied on Terry to endorse “brief” investi-
gative stops based on reasonable suspicion.
407 USS., at 145-146, 92 S.Ct., at 1922-1923.
In this regard, the Court stated that “[{a]
brief stop of a suspicious individual, in or-
der to determine his identity or to maintain
the status quo momentarily while obtaining
more information, may be most reasonable
in light of the facts known to the officer at
the time.” Id., at 146, 92 S.Ct., at 1923.
The weapons search upheld in Adams was
very limited and was based on Terry’s
safety rationale. 407 U.S., at 146, 92 S.Ct.,
at 1928. The Court stated that the purpose
of a “limited” weapons search “is not to

restrains his freedom to walk away, he has

‘seized’ that person.” /d., at 16, 88 S.Ct., at 1877.

See also id., at 19, n. 16, 88 S.Ct., at 1879, n. 16.

This standard, however, is easier to state than it

is to apply. Compare United States v. Menden-

hall, 446 U.S. 544, 550-557, 100 S.Ct. 1870,

In United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422
US. 878, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607
(1975), the Court relied on Terry and Ad-
ams in holding that “when an officer’s
observations lead him reasonably to sus-
pect that a particular vehicle may contain
aliens who are illegally in the country, he
may stop the car briefly and investigate the
circumstances that provoke suspicion.”
422 US., at 881, 95 S.Ct., at 2580.2 The
Court based this relaxation of the tradition-
al probable-cause requirement on the im-
portance of the governmental interest in
stemming the flow of illegal aliens, on the
minimal intrusion of a brief stop, and on
the absence of practical alternatives for
policing the border. Jbid. The Court not-
ed the limited holdings of Terry and Ad-
ams and while authorizing the police to
“question the driver and passengers about
their citizenship and immigration status,
and ... ask them to explain suspicious
circumstances,” the Court expressly stated
that “any further detention or search must
be based on consent or probable cause.”
422 USS., at 881-882, 95 S.Ct., at 2580. See
alsojYbarra v. Illinois, 444 U.S. 85, 98, 100

on reasonable suspicion. They do not pro-
vide the police with a commission to employ
whatever investigative techniques they
deem appropriate. As I stated in Florida
v. Royer, “[t}he scope of a Terry-type ‘in-
vestigative’ stop and any attendant search
must be extremely limited or the Terry
exception would ‘swallow the general rule
that Fourth Amendment seizures [and
searches] are “reasonable” only if based on

S8.Ct., at 1331 (concurring in result), quot-
ing Dunaway v. New York, supra, 442
US., at 213, 99 S.Ct., at 2257.

II

In some respects the Court’s opinion in
this case can be seen as the logical succes-
sor of the plurality opinion in Florida v.
Royer, supra. The plurality opinion in
Royer contained considerable language
which was unnecessary to the judgment,
id., 460 U.S., at 509, 103 S.Ct. at 1330
(BRENNAN, J., concurring in result), re-
garding the permissible scope of Terry in-
vestigative stops. See 460 U.S., at 501-
507, and n. 10, 103 S.Ct., at 1826-1329, and
n. 10. Even assuming, however, that the
Court finds some support in Royer for its
discussion of the scope of Terry stops, the
Court today goes _jwell beyond Royer in
endorsing the notion that the principles of
Terry permit “warrantless seizures of per-
sonal luggage from the custody of the own-
er on the basis of less than probable cause,
for the purpose of pursuing a limited
course of investigation, short of opening
the luggage, that would quickly confirm or
dispel the authorities’ suspicion.” Ante, at

330, 54 L.Ed.2d 331 (1977), to uphold an offi-

cer's order to an individual to get out of his car

suggestion finds no support in Terry or its
progeny and significantly dilutes the
Fourth Amendment’s protections against
government interference with personal
property. In short, it represents a radical
departure from settled Fourth Amendment
principles.

As noted supra, at 2642, Terry and the
cases that followed it authorize a brief
“investigative” stop of an individual based
on reasonable suspicion and a limited
search for weapons if the officer reason-
ably suspects that the individual is armed
and presently dangerous. The purpose of
this brief stop is “to determine [the individ-
ual’s] identity or to maintain the status quo
momentarily while obtaining more informa-
tion....” Adams v. Williams, 407 U.S., at
146, 92 S.Ct., at 1923. Anything more than
a brief stop “must be based on consent or
probable cause.” United States v. Brigno-
ni-Ponce, supra, 422 U.S., at 882, 95 S.Ct.,
at 2580. During the course of this stop,
“the suspect must not be moved or asked
to move more than a short distance; physi-
cal searches are permitted only to the ex-
tent necessary to protect the police officers
involved during the encounter; and, most
importantly, the suspect must be free to
leave after a short time and to decline to
answer the questions put to him.” Kolen-
der v. Lawson, 461 U.S., at 365, 108 S.Ct.,
at 1861 (BRENNAN, J., concurring). It is
true that Terry stops may involve seizures
of personal effects incidental to the seizure
of the person involved. Obviously, an offi-
cer cannot seize a person without also seiz-
ing the personal effects that the individual
has in his possession at the time. But
there is a difference between_jincidental
seizures of personal effects and seizures of
property independent of the seizure of the
person.

The Fourth Amendment protects “ef-
fects” as well as people from unreasonable
searches and seizures. In this regard, Jus-
tice STEVENS pointed out in Texas v.
Brown, 460 U.S. 780, 103 S.Ct. 1535, 75
L.Ed.2d 502 (1983), that “[t]he [Fourth]

4. Putting aside the legality of the independent

Amendment protects two different inter-
ests of the citizen—the interest in retaining
possession of property and the interest in
maintaining personal privacy.” Jd., at 747,
108 S.Ct. at 1546 (opinion concurring in
judgment). “A seizure threatens the for-
mer, a search the latter.” Jbid. Even if an
item is not searched, therefore, its seizure
implicates a protected Fourth Amendment
interest. For this reason, seizures of prop-
erty must be based on probable cause. See

(1970); Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294,
809-810, 87 S.Ct. 1642, 1651, 18 L.Ed.2d
782 (1967). See also Texas v. Brown, su-
pra, 460 US., at 747-748, 103 S.Ct. at
1545-1546 (STEVENS, J., concurring in the
judgment). Neither Terry nor its progeny
changed this rule.

In this case, the officers’ seizure of re-
spondent and their later independent sei-
zure of his luggage implicated separate
Fourth Amendment interests. First, re-
spondent had a protected interest in main-
taining his personal security and privacy.
Terry allows this interest to be overcome,
and authorizes a limited intrusion, if the
officers have reason to suspect that crimi-
nal activity is afoot. Second, respondent
had a protected interest in retaining posses-
sion of his personal effects. While Terry
may authorize seizures of personal effects
incident to a lawful seizure of the person,
nothing in the Terry line of cases autho-
rizes the police to seize personal property,
such as luggage, independent of the sei-
zure of the person. Such seizures signifi-
cantly expand the scope of a Terry stop
and may not be effected on less than proba-

ble jcause.t Obviously, they also signifi- _j 77

cantly expand the scope of the intrusion.

seizure of the luggage, the Court correctly points
L718

2650

The officers did not develop probable
cause to arrest respondent during their en-
counter with him. See 660 F.2d, at 50.
Therefore, they had to let him go. But
despite the absence of probable cause to
arrest respondent, the officers seized his
luggage and deprived him of possession.
Respondent, therefore, was subjected not
only to an invasion of his personal security
and privacy, but also to an independent
dispossession of his personal effects based
simply on reasonable suspicion. It is diffi-
cult to understand how this intrusion is not
more severe than a brief stop for question-
ing or even a limited, on-the-spot patdown
search for weapons.

In my view, as soon as the officers seized
respondent’s luggage, independent of their
seizure of him, they exceeded the scope of
a permissible Terry stop and violated re-
spondent’s Fourth Amendment rights. In
addition, the officers’ seizure of respon-
dent’s luggage violated the established rule
that seizures of personal effects must be
based on probable cause. Their actions,
therefore, should not be upheld.

The Court acknowledges that seizures of
personal property must be based on proba-
ble cause. See ante, at 2641. Despite this
recognition, the Court employs a balancing
test drawn from Terry to conclude that
personal effects may be seized based on
reasonable suspicion. See ante, at 2642-
2644.5 In Dunaway v. New York, 442
U.S. 200, 99 S.Ct. 2248, 60 L.Ed.2d 824
(1979), the Court stated that “[t]he narrow
intrusions involved in [Terry and its proge-
ny] were judged by a balancing test rather
than by the general principle that Fourth
Amendment seizures must be supported by

out that the seizure of luggage “can effectively

restrain the person” beyond the initial stop

“since he is subjected to the possible disruption

of his travel plans in order to remain with his

luggage or to arrange for its return.” Ante, at
2645 (footnote omitted).

5. To the extent that the Court relies on United
States v. Van Leeuwen, 397 U.S. 249, 90 S.Ct.
1029, 25 L.Ed.2d 282 (1970), as support for its
conclusion, see ante, at 2646, n. 6, such reliance
is misplaced. As the Court itself points out, the
holding in Van Leeuwen was expressly limited

462 U.S. 717

the ‘long-prevailing standards’ of probable
cause ... only because these intrusions fell
far short of the kind of intrusion associated
with an arrest.” Jd., at 212, 99 S.Ct. at
2256. As Dunaway suggests, the use of a
balancing test in this case is inappropriate.
First, the intrusion involved in this case is
no longer the “narrow” one contemplated
by the Terry line of cases. See supra, at
2650. In addition, the intrusion involved in
this case involves not only the seizure of a
person, but also the seizure of property.
As noted, supra, at 2647, Terry and its
progeny did not address seizures of proper-
ty. Those cases left unchanged the rule
that seizures of property must be based on
probable cause. See supra, at 2649-2650.
The Terry balancing test should not be
wrenched from its factual and conceptual
moorings.

There are important reasons why bal-
ancing inquiries should not be conducted
except in the most limited circumstances.
Terry and the cases that followed it estab-
lished “isolated exceptions to the general
rule that the Fourth Amendment itself has
already performed the constitutional bal-
ance between police objectives and personal
privacy.” Michigan v. Summers, 452 US.
692, 706, 101 S.Ct. 2587, 2595, 69 L.Ed.2d
340 (1981) (Stewart, J., dissenting). “[T]he
protections intended by the Framers could
all too easily disappear in the consideration
and balancing of the multifarious circum-
stances presented by different cases, espe-
cially when that balancing may be done in
the first instance by police officers en-
gaged in the ‘often competitive enterprise
of ferreting out crime.” Dunaway v.

New York,jsupra, 442 US., at 213, 99 _j719

to the facts of that case. Ante, at 2646, n. 6.
Moreover, the Court of Appeals more than ade-
quately distinguished Van Leeuwen. See 660
F.2d 44, 52-53 (CA2 1981). As the court stated:
“Unlike the dispossession of hand baggage in a
passenger’s custody, which constittites a sub-
stantial intrusion, the mere detention of mail
not in his custody or control amounts to at most
a minimal or technical interference with his
person or effects, resulting in no personal depri-
vation at all.” Ibid.
462 U.S. 720

UNITED STATES v. PLACE

S.Ct., at 2257, quoting Johnson v. United
States, 333 U.S. 10, 14, 68 S.Ct. 367, 369, 92
L.Ed. 436 (1948). The truth of this proposi-
tion is apparent when one considers that
the Court today has employed a balancing
test “to swallow the general rule that [sei-
zures of property] are ‘reasonable’ only if
based on probable cause.” 442 US., at
218, 99 S.Ct., at 2257. Justice BLACK-
MUN’s concern over “an emerging tenden-
cy on the part of the Court to convert the
Terry decision into a general statement
that the Fourth Amendment requires only
that any seizure be reasonable,” ante, at
2652 (BLACKMUN, J., concurring in judg-
ment) (footnote omitted), is certainly justi-
fied.

III

The Court also suggests today, in a dis-
cussion unnecessary to the judgment, that
exposure of respondent’s luggage to a nar-
cotics detection dog “did not constitute a
‘search’ within the meaning of the Fourth
Amendment.” Ante, at 2645. In the Dis-
trict Court, respondent did “not contest the
validity of sniff searches per se....” 498
F.Supp. 1217, 1228 (EDNY 1980). The
Court of Appeals did not reach or discuss
the issue. It was not briefed or argued in
this Court. In short, I agree with Justice
BLACKMUN that the Court should not
address the issue. See post, at 2653
(BLACKMUN, J., concurring in judgment).

I also agree with Justice BLACKMUN’s
suggestion, ibid., that the issue is more
complex than the Court’s discussion would
lead one to believe. As Justice STEVENS
suggested in objecting to “unnecessarily
broad dicta” in United States v. Knotts,
460 U.S. 276, 103 S.Ct. 1081, 75 L.Ed.2d 55
(1988), the use of electronic detection tech-
niques that enhance human perception im-
plicates “especially sensitive concerns.”
Id., at 288, 103 S.Ct., at 1089 (opinion con-
curring in judgment). Obviously, a narcot-
ics detection dog is not an electronic detec-
tion device. Unlike the electronic “beeper”
in Knotts, however, a dog does more than
merely allow the police to do more effi-
ciently what they could do using only their

own senses. A dog adds a new and previ-
ously unobtainable dimension to human
perception. The use of dogs, therefore,
represents a greater intrusion into an indi-
vidual’s privacy. Such use implicates con-
cerns that are at least as sensitive as those
implicated by the use of certain electronic
detection devices. Cf. Katz v. United
States, 389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19
L.Ed.2d 576 (1967).

I have expressed the view that dog sniffs
of people constitute searches. See Doe »v.
Renfrow, 451 U.S. 1022, 1025-1026, 101
S.Ct. 3015, 3017-3018, 69 L.Ed.2d 395
(1981) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting from de-
nial of certiorari). In Doe, I suggested
that sniffs of inanimate objects might
present a different case. Jd., at 1026, n. 4,
101 S.Ct., at 3018, n. 4. In any event, I
would leave the determination of whether
dog sniffs of luggage amount to searches,
and the subsidiary question of what stan-
dards should govern such intrusions, to a
future case providing an appropriate, and
more informed, basis for deciding these
questions.

IV

Justice Douglas was the only dissenter in
Terry. He stated that “[t]here have been
powerful hydraulic pressures throughout
our history that bear heavily on the Court
to water down constitutional guarantees
and give the police the upper hand.” 392
US., at 39, 88 S.Ct. at 1888 (dissenting
opinion). Today, the Court uses Terry as a
justification for submitting to these pres-
sures. Their strength is apparent, for even
when the Court finds that an individual’s
Fourth Amendment rights have been vio-
lated it cannot resist the temptation to
weaken the protections the Amendment af-
fords.

Justice BLACKMUN, with whom Justice
MARSHALL joins, concurring in the judg-
ment.

For me, the Court’s analysis in Part III
of its opinion is quite sufficient to support
its judgment. I agree that on the facts of
an

Li

2652

this case, the detention of Place’s luggage
amounted to, and was functionally identical
with, a seizure of his person. My concern
with the Court’s opinion has to do (a) with
its general discussion in Part II of seizures
of luggage under the Terry v. Ohio, 392
US. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968),
exception to the warrant and probable-
cause requirements, and (b) with the
Court’s haste to resolve the dog-sniff issue.

I

In providing guidance to other courts, we
often include in our opinions material that,
technically, constitutes dictum. I cannot
fault the Court’s desire to set guidelines
for Terry seizures of luggage based on
reasonable suspicion. I am _ concerned,
however, with what appears to me to be an
emerging tendency on the part of the Court
to convert the Terry decision into a general
statement that the Fourth Amendment re-
quires only that any seizure be reasonable.’

I pointed out in dissent in Florida v.
Royer, 460 U.S. 491, 518, 108 S.Ct. 1819,
1382, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983), that our prior
cases suggest a two-step evaluation of sei-
zures under the Fourth Amendment. The
Amendment generally prohibits a seizure
unless it is pursuant to a judicial warrant
issued upon probable cause and particular-
ly describing the items to be seized. See
ante, at 2641; Florida v. Royer, 460 US.,
at 514, 103 S.Ct., at 1833 (dissenting opin-
ion). The Court correctly observes that a
warrant may be dispensed with if the offi-
cer has probable cause and if some excep-
tion to the warrant requirement, such as
exigent circumstances, is applicable. Ante,
at 2641. While the Fourth Amendment
speaks in terms of freedom from unreason-

1, The Court states that the applicability of the
Terry exception “rests on a balancing of the
competing interests to determine the reason-
ableness of the type of seizure involved within
the meaning of ‘the Fourth Amendment's gener-
al proscription against unreasonable searches
and seizures.’” Ante, at 2642, quoting Terry,
392 US., at 20, 88 S.Ct., at 1879. As the context
of the quotation from Terry makes clear, how-
ever, this balancing to determine reasonable-
Ness occurs only under the exceptional circum-
stances that justify the Terry exception:

103 SUPREME COURT REPORTER

462 U.S. 720

able seizures, the Amendment does not
leave the reasonableness of most seizures
to the judgment of courts or government
officers: the Framers of the Amendment
balanced the interests involved and decided
that a seizure is reasonable only if sup-
ported by a judicial warrant based on prob-
able cause. See Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S.
730, 744-745, 103 S.Ct. 1535, 1544, 75
L.Ed.2d 502 (1983) (POWELL, J., concur-
ring); United States v. Rabinowitz, 339
US. 56, 70, 70 S.Ct. 480, 486, 94 L.Ed. 653
(1950) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).

Terry v. Ohio, however, teaches that in
some circumstances a limited seizure that
is less restrictive than a formal arrest may
constitutionally occur upon mere reason-
able suspicion, if “supported by a special
law enforcement need for greater flexibili-
ty.” Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S., at 514,
108 S.Ct., at 1883 (dissenting opinion). See
Michigan v. Summers, 452 U.S. 692, 700,
101 S.Ct. 2587, 2592, 69 L.Ed.2d 340 (1981).
When this exception to the Fourth Amend-
ment’s warrant and probable cause require-
ments is applicable, a reviewing court must
balance the individual’s interest in privacy
against the government’s law enforcement
interest and determine whether the seizure
was reasonable under the circumstances.
Id., at 699-701, 101 S.Ct., at 2593. Only in
this limited context is a court entitled to
engage in any balancing of interests in
determining the validity of a seizure.

Because I agree with the Court that
there is a significant law enforcement in-
terest in interdicting illegal drug traffic in
the Nation’s airports, ante, at 2648; see
Florida v. Royer, 460 US., at 518, 519, 103
S.Ct., at 1885 (dissenting opinion), a limited

“But we deal here with an entire rubric of police

conduct—necessarily swift action predicated

upon the on-the-spot observations of the officer
on the beat—which historically has not been,
and as a practical matter could not be, subjected
to the warrant procedure. Instead, the conduct
involved in this case must be tested by the
Fourth Amendment's general proscription

against unreasonable searches and seizures.”

intrusion caused by a temporary seizure of
luggage for investigative purposes could
fall within the Terry exception. The crit-
ical threshold issue is the intrusiveness of
the seizure. In this jcase, the seizure
went well beyond a minimal intrusion and
therefore cannot fall within the Terry ex-
ception.

II

The Court’s resolution of the status of
dog sniffs under the Fourth Amendment is
troubling for a different reason. The Dis-
trict Court expressly observed that Place
“does not contest the validity of sniff
searches per se.” 498 F.Supp. 1217, 1228
(EDNY 1980).? While Place may have pos-
sessed such a claim, he chose not to raise it
in that court. The issue also was not
presented to or decided by the Court of
Appeals. Moreover, contrary to the
Court’s apparent intimation, ante, at 2644,
an answer to the question is not necessary
to the decision.’ For the purposes of this
case, the precise nature of the legitimate
investigative activity is irrelevant. Re-
gardless of the validity of a dog sniff under
the Fourth Amendment, the seizure was
too intrusive. The Court has no need to
decide the issue here.

As a matter of prudence, decision of the
issue is also unwise. While the Court has
adopted one plausible analysis of the issue,
there are others. For example, a dog sniff
may be a search, but a minimally intrusive
one that could be justified in this situation
under Terry upon mere reasonable suspi-
cion. Neither party has had an opportunity
to brief the issue, and the Court grasps for
the appropriate analysis of the problem.
2. I cannot agree with the Court's assertion that

the diligence of the police in acting on their

suspicion is relevant to the extent of the intru-
sion on Fourth Amendment interests. See ante,

at 2645-2646. It makes little difference to a

traveler whose luggage is seized whether the

police conscientiously followed a lead or bun-
gled the investigation. The duration and intru-
siveness of the seizure is not altered by the

diligence the police exercise. Of course, dil-

igence may be relevant to a court’s determina-

tion of the reasonableness of the seizure once it
is determined that the seizure is sufficiently

Although it is not essential that the Court
ever adopt the views of one of the parties,
it should not decide an issue on which nei-
ther party has expressed any opinion at all.
The Court is certainly in no position to
consider all the ramifications of this impor-
tant issue. Certiorari is currently pending
in two cases that present the issue directly.
United States v. Beale, No. 82-674; Walt-
zer v. United States, No. 82-5491. There
is no reason to avoid a full airing of the
issue in a proper case.

For the foregoing reasons, I concur only
in the judgment of the Court.
