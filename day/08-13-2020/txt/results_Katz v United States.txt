KATZ v. UNITED STATES.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 35. Argued October 17, 1967—Decided December 18, 1967.

Petitioner was convicted under an indictment charging him with
transmitting wagering information by telephone across state lines
in violation of 18 U. S. C. § 1084. Evidence of petitioner’s end
of the conversations, overheard by FBI agents who had attached
an electronic listening and recording device to the outside of the
telephone booth from which the calls were made, was introduced
at the trial. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, find-
ing that there was no Fourth Amendment violation since there
was “no physical entrance into the area occupied by” petitioner.
Held:

1. The Government’s eavesdropping activities violated the
privacy upon which petitioner justifiably relied while using the
telephone booth and thus constituted a “search and seizure” within
the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Pp. 350-353.

(a) The Fourth Amendment governs not only the seizure
of tangible items but extends as well to the recording of oral state-
ments. Silverman v. United States, 365 U.S. 505, 511. P. 353.

(b) Because the Fourth Amendment protects people rather
than places, its reach cannot turn on the presence or absence of a
physical intrusion into any given enclosure. The “trespass” doc-
trine of Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, and Goldman v.
United States, 316 U.S. 129, is no longer controlling. Pp. 351, 353.

2. Although the surveillance in this case may have been so nar-
rowly circumscribed that it could constitutionally have been
authorized in advance, it was not in fact conducted pursuant to
the warrant procedure which is a constitutional precondition of
such electronic surveillance. Pp. 354-359.

369 F. 2d 130, reversed.

Burton Marks and Harvey A. Schneider argued the
cause and filed briefs for petitioner.
348 OCTOBER TERM, 1967.
Opinion of the Court. 389 U.S.

John 8. Martin, Jr., argued the cause for the United
States. With him on the brief were Acting Solicitor
General Spritzer, Assistant Attorney General Vinson and
Beatrice Rosenberg.

Mr. Justice Stewart delivered the opinion of the
Court.

The petitioner was convicted in the District Court for
the Southern District of California under an eight-count
indictment charging him with transmitting wagering in-
formation by telephone from Los Angeles to Miami and
Boston, in violation of a federal statute.t At trial the
Government was permitted, over the petitioner’s objec-
tion, to introduce evidence of the petitioner’s end of tele-
phone conversations, overheard by FBI agents who had
attached an electronic listening and recording device to
the outside of the public telephone booth from which
he had placed his calls. In affirming his conviction, the
Court of Appeals rejected the contention that the record-
ings had been obtained in violation of the Fourth Amend-

118 U.S.C. § 1084. That statute provides in pertinent part:

“(a) Whoever being engaged in the business of betting or
wagering knowingly uses a wire communication facility for the
transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of bets or wagers or
information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers on any sport-
ing event or contest, or for the transmission of a wire communication
which entitles the recipient to receive money or credit as a result
of bets or wagers, or for information assisting in the placing of bets
or wagers, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not
more than two years, or both.

“(b) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the
transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of information for
use in news reporting of sporting events or contests, or for the trans-
mission of information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers
on a sporting event or contest from a State where betting on that
sporting event or contest is legal into a State in which such betting
is legal.”

ment, because “[t]here was no physical entrance into
the area occupied by [the petitioner].”? We granted
certiorari in order to consider the constitutional questions
thus presented.*

The petitioner has phrased those questions as follows:

“A. Whether a public telephone booth is a consti-
tutionally protected area so that evidence obtained
by attaching an electronic listening recording device
to the top of such a booth is obtained in violation
of the right to privacy of the user of the booth.

2369 F. 2d 130, 134.

3386 U. S. 954. The petition for certiorari also challenged the
validity of a warrant authorizing the search of the petitioner’s
premises. In light of our disposition of this case, we do not reach
that issue.

We find no merit in the petitioner’s further suggestion that his
indictment must be dismissed. After his conviction was affirmed by
the Court of Appeals, he testified before a federal grand jury con-
cerning the charges involved here. Because he was compelled to
testify pursuant to a grant of immunity, 48 Stat. 1096, as amended,
47 U.S. C. § 409(2), it is clear that the fruit of his testimony cannot
be used against him in any future trial. But the petitioner asks for
more. He contends that his conviction must be vacated and the
charges against him dismissed lest he be “subjected to [a] penalty ...
on aceount of [a] ... matter... concerning which he [was] com-
pelled .. . to testify ....” 47 U.S.C. § 409 (/). Frank v. United
States, 347 F. 2d 486. We disagree. In relevant part, § 409 (l)
substantially repeats the language of the Compulsory Testimony Act
of 1893, 27 Stat. 448, 49 U.S. C. § 46, which was Congress’ response
to this Court’s statement that an immunity statute can supplant
the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination only if it
affords adequate protection from future prosecution or conviction.
Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U. S. 547, 585-586. The statutory
provision here involved was designed to provide such protection,
see Brown v. United States, 359 U.S. 41, 45-46, not to confer
immunity from punishment pursuant to a prior prosecution and
adjudication of guilt. Cf. Reina v. United States, 364 U. S. 507,
513-514.
350 OCTOBER TERM, 1967.
Opinion of the Court. 389 U.S.

“B. Whether physical penetration of a constitu-
tionally protected area is necessary before a search
and seizure can be said to be violative of the Fourth
Amendment to the United States Constitution.”

We decline to adopt this formulation of the issues.
In the first place, the correct solution of Fourth Amend-
ment problems is not necessarily promoted by incanta-
tion of the phrase “constitutionally protected area.”
Secondly, the Fourth Amendment cannot be translated
into a general constitutional “right to privacy.” That
Amendment protects individual privacy against certain
kinds of governmental intrusion, but its protections go
further, and often have nothing to do with privacy at all.*
Other provisions of the Constitution protect personal
privacy from other forms of governmental invasion.*
But the protection of a person’s general right to privacy—
his right to be let alone by other people ‘—is, like the

*“The average man would very likely not have his feelings
soothed any more by having his property seized openly than by
having it seized privately and by stealth.... And a person can
be just as much, if not more, irritated, annoyed and injured by an
unceremonious public arrest by a policeman as he is by a seizure in
the privacy of his office or home.” Griswold v. Connecticut, 381
U. 8. 479, 509 (dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Buack).

5 The First Amendment, for example, imposes limitations upon
governmental abridgment of “freedom to associate and privacy in
one’s associations.” MAACP v. Alabama, 357 U. S. 449, 462.
The Third Amendment’s prohibition against the unconsented peace-
time quartering of soldiers protects another aspect of privacy from
governmental intrusion. To some extent, the Fifth Amendment too
“reflects the Constitution’s concern for... ‘.. . the right of each
individual “to a private enclave where he may lead a private
life.”’” Tehan v. Shott, 382 U. 8S. 406, 416. Virtually every
governmental action interferes with personal privacy to some
degree. The question in each case is whether that interference
violates a command of the United States Constitution.

193 (1890).

protection of his property and of his very life, left largely
to the law of the individual States.’

Because of the misleading way the issues have been
formulated, the parties have attached great significance
to the characterization of the telephone booth from
which the petitioner placed his calls. The petitioner
has strenuously argued that the booth was a “constitu-
tionally protected area.” The Government has main-
tained with equal vigor that it was not.* But this effort
to decide whether or not a given “area,” viewed in the
abstract, is “constitutionally protected” deflects atten-
tion from the problem presented by this case. For the
Fourth Amendment protects people, not places. What
a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his
own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amend-
ment protection. See Lewis v. United States, 385 U.S.
206, 210; United States v. Lee, 274 U.S. 559, 563. But
what he seeks to preserve as private, even in an area
accessible to the public, may be constitutionally pro-

7 See, e. g., Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U.S. 874. Cf. Breard v. Alez-
andria, 341 U. 8. 622; Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U. S. 77.

8In support of their respective claims, the parties have compiled
competing lists of “protected areas” for our consideration. It ap-
pears to be common ground that a private home is such an area,
Weeks v. United States, 232 U. 8. 383, but that an open field is
not. Hester v. United States, 265 U.S. 57. Defending the inclu-
sion of a telephone booth in his list the petitioner cites United
States v. Stone, 232 F. Supp. 396, and United States v. Madison,
32 L. W. 2243 (D. C. Ct. Gen. Sess.). Urging that the telephone
booth should be excluded, the Government finds support in United
States v. Borgese, 235 F. Supp. 286.

®It is true that this Court has occasionally described its con-
clusions in terms of “constitutionally protected areas,” see, e. g.,
Silverman v. United States, 365 U.S. 505, 510, 512; Lopez v. United
States, 373 U.S. 427, 488-439; Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41, 57,
59, but we have never suggested that this concept can serve as a
talismanic solution to every Fourth Amendment problem.

tected. See Rios v. United States, 364 U. S. 253; Ex
parte Jackson, 96 U. 8S. 727, 783.

The Government stresses the fact that the telephone
booth from which the petitioner made his calls was
constructed partly of glass, so that he was as visible
after he entered it as he would have been if he had re-
mained outside. But what he sought to exclude when
he entered the booth was not the intruding eye—it was
the uninvited ear. He did not shed his right to do so
simply because he made his calls from a place where he
might be seen. No less than an individual in a business
office,” in a friend’s apartment,” or in a taxicab,** a per-
son in a telephone booth may rely upon the protection
of the Fourth Amendment. One who occupies it, shuts
the door behind him, and pays the toll that permits
him to place a call is surely entitled to assume that the
words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broad-
cast to the world. To read the Constitution more nar-
rowly is to ignore the vital role that the public telephone
has come to play in private communication.

The Government contends, however, that the activities
of its agents in this case should not be tested by Fourth
Amendment requirements, for the surveillance technique
they employed involved no physical penetration of the
telephone booth from which the petitioner placed his
calls, It is true that the absence of such penetration
was at one time thought to foreclose further Fourth
Amendment inquiry, Olmstead v. United States, 277
U. S. 438, 457, 464, 466; Goldman v. United States,
316 U. S. 129, 134-136, for that Amendment was
thought to limit only searches and seizures of tangible

property.* But “[t]he premise that property interests
control the right of the Government to search and seize
has been discredited.” Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294,
304. Thus, although a closely divided Court supposed
in Olmstead that surveillance without any trespass and
without the seizure of any material object fell outside
the ambit of the Constitution, we have since departed
from the narrow view on which that decision rested.
Indeed, we have expressly held that the Fourth Amend-
ment governs not only the seizure of tangible items, but
extends as well to the recording of oral statements, over-
heard without any “technical trespass under . . . local
property law.” Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S.
505, 511. Once this much is acknowledged, and once it is
recognized that the Fourth Amendment protects people—
and not simply “areas’”—against unreasonable searches
and seizures, it becomes clear that the reach of that
Amendment cannot turn upon the presence or absence
of a physical intrusion into any given enclosure.

We conclude that the underpinnings of Olmstead and
Goldman have been so eroded by our subsequent deci-
sions that the “trespass” doctrine there enunciated can
no longer be regarded as controlling. The Government’s
activities in electronically listening to and recording the
petitioner’s words violated the privacy upon which he
justifiably relied while using the telephone booth and
thus constituted a “search and seizure” within the mean-
ing of the Fourth Amendment. The fact that the elec-
tronic device employed to achieve that end did not
happen to penetrate the wall of the booth can have no
constitutional significance.

13 See Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 464-466. We do
not deal in this case with the law of detention or arrest under the
Fourth Amendment.
354 OCTOBER TERM, 1967.
Opinion of the Court. 389 U.S.

The question remaining for decision, then, is whether
the search and seizure conducted in this case complied
with constitutional standards. In that regard, the Gov-
ernment’s position is that its agents acted in an entirely
defensible manner: They did not begin their electronic
surveillance until investigation of the petitioner’s activi-
ties had established a strong probability that he was using
the telephone in question to transmit gambling informa-
tion to persons in other States, in violation of federal law.
Moreover, the surveillance was limited, both in scope
and in duration, to the specific purpose of establishing the
contents of the petitioner’s unlawful telephonic communi-
cations. The agents confined their surveillance to the
brief periods during which he used the telephone booth,*
and they took great care to overhear only the conversa-
tions of the petitioner himself.’

Accepting this account of the Government’s actions
as accurate, it is clear that this surveillance was so nar-
rowly circumscribed that a duly authorized magistrate,
properly notified of the need for such investigation,
specifically informed of the basis on which it was to
proceed, and clearly apprised of the precise intrusion
it would entail, could constitutionally have authorized,
with appropriate safeguards, the very limited search
and seizure that the Government asserts in fact took
place. Only last Term we sustained the validity of

44 Based upon their previous visual observations of the petitioner,
the agents correctly predicted that he would use the telephone
booth for several minutes at approximately the same time each
morning. The petitioner was subjected to electronic surveillance
only during this predetermined period. Six recordings, averaging
some three minutes each, were obtained and admitted in evidence.
They preserved the petitioner’s end of conversations concerning
the placing of bets and the receipt of wagering information.

15On the single occasion when the statements of another person
were inadvertently intercepted, the agents refrained from listening to
them,

such an authorization, holding that, under sufficiently
“precise and discriminate circumstances,” a federal court
may empower government agents to employ a concealed
electronic device “for the narrow and particularized pur-
pose of ascertaining the truth of the . . . allegations”
of a “detailed factual affidavit alleging the commission
of a specific criminal offense.” Osborn v. United States,
385 U. S. 323, 329-380. Discussing that holding, the
Court in Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41, said that “the
order authorizing the use of the electronic device” in
Osborn “afforded similar protections to those .. . of
conventional warrants authorizing the seizure of tangible
evidence.” Through those protections, “no greater inva-
sion of privacy was permitted than was necessary under
the circumstances.” IJd., at 57° Here, too, a similar

16 Although the protections afforded the petitioner in Osborn were
“similar ... to those ... of conventional warrants,” they were
not identical. A conventional warrant ordinarily serves to notify
the suspect of an intended search. But if Osborn had been told in
advance that federal officers intended to record his conversations,
the point of making such recordings would obviously have been lost;
the evidence in question could not have been obtained. In omitting
any requirement of advance notice, the federal court that authorized
electronic surveillance in Osborn simply recognized, as has this
Court, that officers need not announce their purpose before conduct-
ing an otherwise authorized search if such an announcement would
provoke the escape of the suspect or the destruction of critical
evidence. See Ker v. California, 374 U.S. 23, 87-41.

Although some have thought that this “exception to the notice
Tequirement where exigent circumstances are present,” id., at 39,
should be deemed inapplicable where police enter a home before its
occupants are aware that officers are present, id., at 55-58 (opinion
of Mr. Justice BRENNAN), the reasons for such a limitation have
no bearing here. However true it may be that “[i]nnocent citizens
should not suffer the shock, fright or embarrassment attendant upon
an unannounced police intrusion,” id., at 57, and that “the require-
ment of awareness . . . serves to minimize the hazards of the officers’
dangerous calling,” id., at 57-58, these considerations are not rele-

Opinion of the Court. 389 U.S.

judicial order could have accommodated “the legitimate
needs of law enforcement” ** by authorizing the carefully
limited use of electronic surveillance.

The Government urges that, because its agents relied
upon the decisions in Olmstead and Goldman, and be-
cause they did no more here than they might properly
have done with prior judicial sanction, we should retro-
actively validate their conduct. That we cannot do.
It is apparent that the agents in this case acted with
restraint. Yet the inescapable fact is that this restraint
was imposed by the agents themselves, not by a judicial
officer. They were not required, before commencing the
search, to present their estimate of probable cause for
detached scrutiny by a neutral magistrate. They were
not compelled, during the conduct of the search itself, to
observe precise limits established in advance by a spe-
cific court order. Nor were they directed, after the
search had been completed, to notify the authorizing
magistrate in detail of all that had been seized. In the
absence of such safeguards, this Court has never sus-
tained a search upon the sole ground that officers reason-
ably expected to find evidence of a particular crime and
voluntarily confined their activities to the least intrusive

vant to the problems presented by judicially authorized electronic
surveillance.

Nor do the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure impose an inflex-
ible requirement of prior notice. Rule 41 (d) does require federal
officers to serve upon the person searched a copy of the warrant
and a receipt describing the material obtained, but it does not
invariably require that this be done before the search takes place.
Nordelli v. United States, 24 F. 2d 665, 666-667.

Thus the fact that the petitioner in Osborn was unaware that
his words were being electronically transcribed did not prevent this
Court from sustaining his conviction, and did not prevent the Court
in Berger from reaching the conclusion that the use of the recording
device sanctioned in Osborn was entirely lawful. 388 U.S. 41, 57.

means consistent with that end. Searches conducted
without warrants have been held unlawful “notwith-
standing facts unquestionably showing probable cause,”
Agnello v. United States, 269 U. S. 20, 33, for the Con-
stitution requires “that the deliberate, impartial judg-
ment of a judicial officer . . . be interposed between the
citizen and the police. ...” Wong Sun v. United States,
371 U. S. 471, 481-482. “Over and again this Court
has emphasized that the mandate of the [Fourth]
Amendment requires adherence to judicial processes,”
United States v. Jeffers, 342 U. S. 48, 51, and that
searches conducted outside the judicial process, without
prior approval! by judge or magistrate, are per se unrea-
sonable under the Fourth Amendment —subject only
to a few specifically established and well-delineated
exceptions.”®

It is difficult to imagine how any of those excep-
tions could ever apply to the sort of search and seizure
involved in this case. Even electronic surveillance sub-
stantially contemporaneous with an individual’s arrest
could hardly be deemed an “incident” of that arrest.”

18 See, e. g., Jones v. United States, 357 U. S. 493, 497-499; Rios
vy. United States, 364 U. S. 253, 261; Chapman v. United States,
365 U.S. 610, 613-615; Stoner v. California, 376 U.S. 483, 486-487.

1° See, e. g., Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, 153, 156;
McDonald v. United States, 385 U. 8. 451, 454-456; Brinegar v.
United States, 338 U. S. 160, 174-177; Cooper v. California, 386
U.S. 58; Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294, 298-300.

20In Agnello v. United States, 269 U. 8. 20, 30, the Court stated:
“The right without a search warrant contemporaneously to search
persons lawfully arrested while committing crime and to search the
place where the arrest is made in order to find and seize things
connected with the crime as its fruits or as the means by which
it was committed, as well as weapons and other things to effect an
escape from custody, is not to be doubted.”

Whatever one’s view of “the long-standing practice of searching for
other proofs of guilt within the control of the accused found upon
arrest,” United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U. S. 56, 61; ef. id., at
358 OCTOBER TERM, 1967.
Opinion of the Court. 389 U.S.

Nor could the use of electronic surveillance without prior
authorization be justified on grounds of “hot pursuit.” **
And, of course, the very nature of electronic surveillance
precludes its use pursuant to the suspect’s consent.”

The Government does not question these basic princi-
ples. Rather, it urges the creation of a new exception to
cover this case." It argues that surveillance of a tele-
phone booth should be exempted from the usual require-
ment of advance authorization by a magistrate upon a
showing of probable cause. We cannot agree. Omission
of such authorization

“bypasses the safeguards provided by an objective
predetermination of probable cause, and substitutes
instead the far less reliable procedure of an after-the-
event justification for the . . . search, too likely to
be subtly influenced by the familiar shortcomings of
hindsight judgment.” Beck v. Ohio, 379 U. 8S. 89,
96.

And bypassing a neutral predetermination of the scope
of a search leaves individuals secure from Fourth Amend-

71-79 (dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter), the concept
of an “incidental” search cannot readily be extended to include
surreptitious surveillance of an individual either immediately before,
or immediately after, his arrest.

21 Although “{t]he Fourth Amendment does not require police
officers to delay in the course of an investigation if to do so would
gravely endanger their lives or the lives of others,” Warden v.
Hayden, 387 U. S. 294, 298-299, there seems little likelihood that
electronic surveillance would be a realistic possibility in a situation
so fraught with urgency.

22 A search to which an individual consents meets Fourth Amend-
ment requirements, Zap v. United States, 328 U. S. 624, but of
course “the usefulness of electronic surveillance depends on lack
of notice to the suspect.” Lopez v. United States, 373 U. S. 427,
463 (dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice BRENNAN).

23 Whether safeguards other than prior authorization by a magis-
trate would satisfy the Fourth Amendment in a situation involving
the national security is a question not presented by this case.

ment violations “only in the discretion of the police.”
Td., at 97.

These considerations do not vanish when the search
in question is transferred from the setting of a home,
an office, or a hotel room to that of a telephone
booth. Wherever a man may be, he is entitled to know
that he will remain free from unreasonable searches and
seizures. The government agents here ignored “the pro-
cedure of antecedent justification ... that is central to
the Fourth Amendment,” * a procedure that we hold to
be a constitutional precondition of the kind of electronic
surveillance involved in this case. Because the surveil-
lance here failed to meet that condition, and because it
led to the petitioner’s conviction, the judgment must be
reversed,

It is so ordered.

Mr. Justice MarsHAL took no part in the consid-
eration or decision of this case.

Mr. Justice Douctas, with whom Mr. Justice Bren-
NAN joins, concurring.

While I join the opinion of the Court, I feel compelled
to reply to the separate concurring opinion of my Brother
Wuirte, which I view as a wholly unwarranted green light
for the Executive Branch to resort to electronic eaves-
dropping without a warrant in cases which the Executive
Branch itself labels “national security” matters.

Neither the President nor the Attorney General is a
magistrate. In matters where they believe national
security may be involved they are not detached, disin-
terested, and neutral as a court or magistrate must be.
Under the separation of powers created by the Consti-
tution, the Executive Branch is not supposed to be neu-
tral and disinterested. Rather it should vigorously inves-

24See Osborn v. United States, 385 U. S. 328, 330.
360 OCTOBER TERM, 1967.
Hartan, J., concurring. 389 U.S.

tigate and prevent breaches of national security and pros-
ecute those who violate the pertinent federal laws. The
President and Attorney General are properly interested
parties, cast in the role of adversary, in national security
cases. They may even be the intended victims of sub-
versive action. Since spies and saboteurs are as entitled
to the protection of the Fourth Amendment as suspected
gamblers like petitioner, I cannot agree that where spies
and saboteurs are involved adequate protection of Fourth
Amendment rights is assured when the President and
Attorney General assume both the position of adversary-
and-prosecutor and disinterested, neutral magistrate.

There is, so far as I understand constitutional history,
no distinction under the Fourth Amendment between
types of crimes. Article III, § 3, gives “treason” a very
narrow definition and puts restrictions on its proof. But
the Fourth Amendment draws no lines between various
substantive offenses. The arrests in cases of “hot pur-
suit” and the arrests on visible or other evidence of prob-
able cause cut across the board and are not peculiar to
any kind of crime.

I would respect the present lines of distinction and not
improvise because a particular crime seems particularly
heinous. When the Framers took that step, as they did
with treason, the worst crime of all, they made their
purpose manifest.

Mr. Justice Haran, concurring.

I join the opinion of the Court, which I read to hold
only (a) that an enclosed telephone booth is an area
where, like a home, Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S.
383, and unlike a field, Hester v. United States, 265 U. S.
57, a person has a constitutionally protected reasonable
expectation of privacy; (b) that electronic as well as

ment; and (c) that the invasion of a constitutionally
protected area by federal authorities is, as the Court has
long held, presumptively unreasonable in the absence of
a search warrant.

As the Court’s opinion states, “the Fourth Amend-
ment protects people, not places.” The question, however,
is what protection it affords to those people. Generally,
as here, the answer to that question requires reference to
a “place.” My understanding of the rule that has
emerged from prior decisions is that there is a twofold
requirement, first that a person have exhibited an actual
(subjective) expectation of privacy and, second, that the
expectation be one that society is prepared to recognize
as “reasonable.” Thus a man’s home is, for most pur-
poses, a place where he expects privacy, but objects,
activities, or statements that he exposes to the “plain
view” of outsiders are not “protected” because no inten-
tion to keep them to himself has been exhibited. On the
other hand, conversations in the open would not be pro-
tected against being overheard, for the expectation of
privacy under the circumstances would be unreasonable.
Cf. Hester v. United States, supra.

The critical fact in this case is that “{o]ne who occu-
pies it, [a telephone booth] shuts the door behind him,
and pays the toll that permits him to place a call is
surely entitled to assume” that his conversation is not
being intercepted. Ante, at 352. The point is not that
the booth is “accessible to the public” at other times,
ante, at 351, but that it is a temporarily private place
whose momentary occupants’ expectations of freedom
from intrusion are recognized as reasonable. Cf. Rios v.
United States, 364 U.S. 253.

In Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S. 505, we held
that eavesdropping accomplished by means of an elec-
tronie device that penetrated the premises occupied by
petitioner was a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
362 OCTOBER TERM, 1967.
Wuits, J., concurring. 389 U.S.

That case established that interception of conversations
reasonably intended to be private could constitute a
“search and seizure,” and that the examination or taking
of physical property was not required. This view of the
Fourth Amendment was followed in Wong Sun v. United
States, 371 U. S. 471, at 485, and Berger v. New York,
888 U.S, 41, at 51. Also compare Osborn v. United States,
385 U. 8. 328, at 327. In Silverman we found it unneces-
sary to re-examine Goldman v. United States, 316 U. 8.
129, which had held that electronic surveillance accom-
plished without the physical penetration of petitioner’s
premises by a tangible object did not violate the Fourth
Amendment. This case requires us to reconsider Gold-
man, and I agree that it should now be overruled.* Its
limitation on Fourth Amendment protection is, in the
present day, bad physics as well as bad law, for rea-
sonable expectations of privacy may be defeated by
electronic as well as physical invasion.

Finally, I do not read the Court’s opinion to declare
that no interception of a conversation one-half of which
occurs in a public telephone booth can be reasonable in
the absence of a warrant, As elsewhere under the Fourth
Amendment, warrants are the general rule, to which the
legitimate needs of law enforcement may demand specific
exceptions. It will be time enough to consider any such
exceptions when an appropriate occasion presents itself,
and I agree with the Court that this is not one.

Mr. Justice WHITE, concurring.

I agree that the official surveillance of petitioner’s
telephone conversations in a public booth must be sub-

*T also think that the course of development evinced by Silverman,
supra, Wong Sun, supra, Berger, supra, and today’s decision must
be recognized as overruling Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438,
which essentially rested on the ground that conversations were not
subject to the protection of the Fourth Amendment.

jected to the test of reasonableness under the Fourth
Amendment and that on the record now before us the
particular surveillance undertaken was unreasonable
absent a warrant properly authorizing it. This appli-
cation of the Fourth Amendment need not interfere with
legitimate needs of law enforcement.*

In joining the Court’s opinion, I note the Court’s
acknowledgment that there are circumstances in which
it is reasonable to search without a warrant. In this
connection, in footnote 23 the Court points out that
today’s decision does not reach national security cases.
Wiretapping to protect the security of the Nation has
been authorized by successive Presidents. The present
Administration would apparently save national security
cases from restrictions against wiretapping. See Berger
v. New York, 388 U.S. 41, 112-118 (1967) (Wurrs, J.,

*In previous cases, which are undisturbed by today’s decision,
the Court has upheld, as reasonable under the Fourth Amend-
ment, admission at trial of evidence obtained (1) by an undercover
police agent to whom a defendant speaks without knowledge that
he is in the employ of the police, Hoffa v. United States, 385 U.S.
293 (1966); (2) by a recording device hidden on the person of
such an informant, Lopez v. United States, 373 U. 8. 427 (1963);
Osborn v. United States, 385 U. S. 323 (1966); and (3) by a
policeman listening to the secret micro-wave transmissions of an
agent conversing with the defendant in another location, On Lee v.
United States, 348 U. S. 747 (1952). When one man speaks to
another he takes all the risks ordinarily inherent in so doing, includ-
ing the risk that the man to whom he speaks will make public
what he has heard. The Fourth Amendment does not protect
against, unreliable (or law-abiding) associates. Hoffa v. United
States, supra. It is but a logical and reasonable extension of this
principle that a man take the risk that his hearer, free to memorize
what he hears for later verbatim repetitions, is instead recording it
or transmitting it to another. The present case deals with an
entirely different situation, for as the Court emphasizes the peti-
tioner “sought to exclude . . . the uninvited ear,” and spoke under
circumstances in which a reasonable person would assume that
uninvited ears were not listening.

dissenting). We should not require the warrant pro-
cedure and the magistrate’s judgment if the President of
the United States or his chief legal officer, the Attorney
General, has considered the requirements of national
security and authorized electronic surveillance as
reasonable.

Mr. Justice Buack, dissenting.

If I could agree with the Court that eavesdropping
carried on by electronic means (equivalent to wiretap-
ping) constitutes a “search” or “seizure,” I would be
happy to join the Court’s opinion. For on that premise
my Brother Stewart sets out methods in accord with
the Fourth Amendment to guide States in the enactment
and enforcement of laws passed to regulate wiretapping
by government. In this respect today’s opinion differs
sharply from Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41, decided
last Term, which held void on its face a New York statute
authorizing wiretapping on warrants issued by magis-
trates on showings of probable cause. The Berger case
also set up what appeared to be insuperable obstacles to
the valid passage of such wiretapping laws by States.
The Court’s opinion in this case, however, removes the
doubts about state power in this field and abates to a
large extent the confusion and near-paralyzing effect of
the Berger holding. Notwithstanding these good efforts
of the Court, I am still unable to agree with its interpre-
tation of the Fourth Amendment.

My basie objection is twofold: (1) I do not believe
that the words of the Amendment will bear the mean-
ing given them by today’s decision, and (2) I do not
believe that it is the proper role of this Court to rewrite
the Amendment in order “to bring it into harmony with
the times” and thus reach a result that many people
believe to be desirable.
KATZ v. UNITED STATES. 365
347 Brack, J., dissenting.

While I realize that an argument based on the mean-
ing of words lacks the scope, and no doubt the appeal,
of broad policy discussions and philosophical discourses
on such nebulous subjects as privacy, for me the language
of the Amendment is the crucial place to look in constru-
ing a written document such as our Constitution. The
Fourth Amendment says that

“The right of the people to be secure in their per-
sons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable
searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no
Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, sup-
ported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly
describing the place to be searched, and the persons
or things to be seized.”

The first clause protects “persons, houses, papers, and
effects, against. unreasonable searches and seizures... .”
These words connote the idea of tangible things with size,
form, and weight, things capable of being searched, seized,
or both. The second clause of the Amendment still fur-
ther establishes its Framers’ purpose to limit its protection
to tangible things by providing that no warrants shall
issue but those “particularly describing the place to be
searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” A con-
versation overheard by eavesdropping, whether by plain
snooping or wiretapping, is not tangible and, under the
normally accepted meanings of the words, can neither be
searched nor seized. In addition the language of the sec-
ond clause indicates that the Amendment refers not only
to something tangible so it can be seized but to some-
thing already in existence so it can be described. Yet the
Court’s interpretation would have the Amendment apply
to overhearing future conversations which by their very
nature are nonexistent until they take place. How can
one “describe” a future conversation, and, if one cannot,
how can a magistrate issue a warrant to eavesdrop one in
the future? It is argued that information showing what

is expected to be said is sufficient to limit the boundaries
of what later can be admitted into evidence; but does
such general information really meet the specific language
of the Amendment which says “particularly describing”?
Rather than using language in a completely artificial
way, I must conclude that the Fourth Amendment sim-
ply does not apply to eavesdropping.

Tapping telephone wires, of course, was an unknown
possibility at the time the Fourth Amendment was
adopted. But eavesdropping (and wiretapping is noth-
ing more than eavesdropping by telephone) was, as
even the majority opinion in Berger, supra, recognized,
“an ancient practice which at common law was con-
demned as a nuisance. 4 Blackstone, Commentaries
168. In those days the eavesdropper listened by naked
ear under the eaves of houses or their windows, or be-
yond their walls seeking out private discourse.” 388
U.§S., at 45. There can be no doubt that the Framers
were aware of this practice, and if they had desired to
outlaw or restrict the use of evidence obtained by eaves-
dropping, I believe that they would have used the appro-
priate language to do so in the Fourth Amendment. They
certainly would not have left such a task to the ingenuity
of language-stretching Judges. No one, it seems to me,
can read the debates on the Bill of Rights without
reaching the conclusion that its Framers and critics well
knew the meaning of the words they used, what they
would be understood to mean by others, their scope and
their limitations. Under these circumstances it strikes
me as a charge against their scholarship, their common
sense and their candor to give to the Fourth Amend-
ment’s language the eavesdropping meaning the Court
imputes to it today.

I do not deny that common sense requires and that
this Court often has said that the Bill of Rights’ safe-
guards should be given a liberal construction. This

principle, however, does not justify construing the search
and seizure amendment as applying to eavesdropping
or the “seizure” of conversations. The Fourth Amend-
ment was aimed directly at the abhorred practice of
breaking in, ransacking and searching homes and other
buildings and seizing people’s personal belongings with-
out warrants issued by magistrates. The Amendment
deserves, and this Court has given it, a liberal construc-
tion in order to protect against warrantless searches of
buildings and seizures of tangible personal effects. But
until today this Court has refused to say that eavesdrop-
ping comes within the ambit of Fourth Amendment
restrictions. See, e. g., Olmstead v. United States, 277
U. S. 488 (1928), and Goldman v. United States, 316
U. S. 129 (1942).

So far I have attempted to state why I think the
words of the Fourth Amendment prevent its application
to eavesdropping. It is important now to show that
this has been the traditional view of the Amendment’s
scope since its adoption and that the Court’s decision
in this case, along with its amorphous holding in Berger
last Term, marks the first real departure from that view.

The first case to reach this Court which actually in-
volved a clear-cut test of the Fourth Amendment’s appli-
cability to eavesdropping through a wiretap was, of
course, Olmstead, supra. In holding that the interception
of private telephone conversations by means of wiretap-
ping was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment, this
Court, speaking through Mr. Chief Justice Taft, exam-
ined the language of the Amendment and found, just as
I do now, that the words could not be stretched to encom-
pass overheard conversations:

“The Amendment itself shows that the search is
to be of material things—the person, the house, his
papers or his effects. The description of the war-
rant necessary to make the proceeding lawful, is
368 OCTOBER TERM, 1967.
Brack, J., dissenting. 389 U.S.

that it must specify the place to be searched and
the Reno or bhenpe to be seized. .

“Justice Bradley i in the Boyd case [Boyd v. United
States, 116 U. S. 616], and Justice Clark[e] in the
Gouled case [Gouled v. United States, 255 U. S.
298], said that the Fifth Amendment and the Fourth
Amendment were to be liberally construed to effect
the purpose of the framers of the Constitution in
the interest of liberty. But that can not justify
enlargement of the language employed beyond the
possible practical meaning of houses, persons, papers,
and effects, or so to apply the words search and
seizure as to forbid hearing or sight.” 277 U.S., at
464-465.

Goldman v. United States, 316 U. S. 129, is an even
clearer example of this Court’s traditional refusal to con-
sider eavesdropping as being covered by the Fourth
Amendment. There federal agents used a detectaphone,
which was placed on the wall of an adjoining room, to
listen to the conversation of a defendant carried on in
his private office and intended to be confined within
the four walls of the room. This Court, referring to
Olmstead, found no Fourth Amendment violation.

It should be noted that the Court in Olmstead based
its decision squarely on the fact that wiretapping or
eavesdropping does not violate the Fourth Amendment.
As shown, supra, in the cited quotation from the case,
the Court went to great pains to examine the actual lan-
guage of the Amendment and found that the words used
simply could not be stretched to cover eavesdropping.
That there was no trespass was not the determinative
factor, and indeed the Court in citing Hester v. United
States, 265 U. S. 57, indicated that even where there
was a trespass the Fourth Amendment does not auto-
matically apply to evidence obtained by “hearing or
KATZ v. UNITED STATES. 369
347 Buiack, J., dissenting.

sight.” The Olmstead majority characterized Hester as
holding “that the testimony of two officers of the law
who trespassed on the defendant’s land, concealed them-
selves one hundred yards away from his house and saw
him come out and hand a bottle of whiskey to another,
was not inadmissible. While there was a trespass, there
was no search of person, house, papers or effects.” 277
U.S., at 465. Thus the clear holding of the Olmstead
and Goldman cases, undiluted by any question of tres-
pass, is that eavesdropping, in both its original and mod-
ern forms, is not violative of the Fourth Amendment.

While my reading of the Olmstead and Goldman cases
convinces me that they were decided on the basis of the
inapplicability of the wording of the Fourth Amendment
to eavesdropping, and not on any trespass basis, this is
not to say that unauthorized intrusion has not played
an important role in search and seizure cases. This Court
has adopted an exclusionary rule to bar evidence obtained
by means of such intrusions. As I made clear in my
dissenting opinion in Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41,
76, I continue to believe that this exclusionary rule for-
mulated in Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383, rests
on the “supervisory power” of this Court over other
federal courts and is not rooted in the Fourth Amend-
ment. See Wolf v. Colorado, concurring opinion, 338
U.S. 25, 39, at 40. See also Mapp v. Ohio, concurring
opinion, 367 U.S. 648, 661-666. This rule has caused the
Court to refuse to accept evidence where there has been
such an intrusion regardless of whether there has been a
search or seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment.
As this Court said in Lopez v. United States, 373 U.S.
427, 438-439, “The Court has in the past sustained in-
stances of ‘electronic eavesdropping’ against constitu-
tional challenge, when devices have been used to enable
government agents to overhear conversations which would
have been beyond the reach of the human ear [citing

Olmstead and Goldman]. It has been insisted only that
the electronic device not be planted by an unlawful
physical invasion of a constitutionally protected area.
Silverman v. United States.”

To support its new interpretation of the Fourth Amend-
ment, which in effect amounts to a rewriting of the’
language, the Court’s opinion concludes that “the under-
pinnings of Olmstead and Goldman have been . . . eroded
by our subsequent decisions ....” But the only cases
cited as accomplishing this “eroding” are Silverman v.
United States, 365 U. S. 505, and Warden v. Hayden,
387 U.S. 294. Neither of these cases “eroded” Olmstead
or Goldman. Silverman is an interesting choice since
there the Court expressly refused to re-examine the ra-
tionale of Olmstead or Goldman although such a re-
examination was strenuously urged upon the Court by
the petitioners’ counsel. Also it is significant that in
Silverman, as the Court described it, “the eavesdropping
was accomplished by means of an unauthorized physical
penetration into the premises occupied by the peti-
tioners,” 365 U.S., at 509, thus calling into play the super-
visory exclusionary rule of evidence. As I have pointed
out above, where there is an unauthorized intrusion, this
Court has rejected admission of evidence obtained regard-
less of whether there has been an unconstitutional search
and seizure. The majority’s decision here relies heavily
on the statement in the opinion that the Court “need not
pause to consider whether or not there was a technical
trespass under the local property law relating to party
walls.” (At 511.) Yet this statement should not becloud
the fact that time and again the opinion emphasizes that
there has been an unauthorized intrusion: “For a fair
reading of the record in this case shows that the eaves-
dropping was accomplished by means of an unauthorized
physical penetration into the premises occupied by the
petitioners.” (At 509, emphasis added.) “Eavesdropping
KATZ v. UNITED STATES. 371
347 Buack, J., dissenting.

accomplished by means of such a physical intrusion
is beyond the pale of even those decisions... .”
(At 509, emphasis added.) “Here . . . the officers over-
heard the petitioners’ conversations only by usurping

part of the petitioners’ house or office... .” (At
511, emphasis added.) “[DJecision here . . . is based
upon the reality of an actual intrusion... .” (At 512,

emphasis added.) “We find no occasion to re-examine
Goldman here, but we decline to go beyond it, by even
a fraction of an inch.” (At 512, emphasis added.) Asif
this were not enough, Justices Clark and Whittaker con-
curred with the following statement: “In view of the
determination by the majority that the unauthorized
physical penetration into petitioners’ premises consti-
tuted sufficient trespass to remove this case from the
coverage of earlier decisions, we feel obliged to join in the
Court’s opinion.” (At 513, emphasis added.) As I made
clear in my dissent in Berger, the Court in Silverman held
the evidence should be excluded by virtue of the exclu-
sionary rule and “I would not have agreed with the
Court’s opinion in Silverman ... had I thought that the
result depended on finding a violation of the Fourth
Amendment....” 388 U.S., at 79-80. In light of this
and the fact that the Court expressly refused to re-
examine Olmstead and Goldman, I cannot read Silver-
man as overturning the interpretation stated very plainly
in Olmstead and followed in Goldman that eavesdropping
is not covered by the Fourth Amendment.

The other “eroding” case cited in the Court’s opinion
is Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294. It appears that this
case is cited for the proposition that the Fourth Amend-
ment applies to “intangibles,” such as conversation, and
the following ambiguous statement is quoted from the
opinion: “The premise that property interests control
the right of the Government to search and seize has been
discredited.” 387 U.S., at 304. But far from being con-

276-943 O - 68 - 31

Buack, J., dissenting. 389 U.S.

cerned with eavesdropping, Warden v. Hayden upholds
the seizure of clothes, certainly tangibles by any defi-
nition. The discussion of property interests was involved
only with the common-law rule that the right to seize
property depended upon proof of a superior property
interest.

Thus, I think that although the Court attempts to con-
vey the impression that for some reason today Olmstead
and Goldman are no longer good law, it must face up to
the fact that these cases have never been overruled or even
“eroded.” It is the Court’s opinions in this case and
Berger which for the first time since 1791, when the
Fourth Amendment was adopted, have declared that
eavesdropping is subject to Fourth Amendment restric-
tions and that conversations can be “seized.”* I must
align myself with all those judges who up to this year
have never been able to impute such a meaning to the
words of the Amendment.

*The first paragraph of my Brother Hartan’s concurring opinion
is susceptible of the interpretation, although probably not intended,
that this Court “has long held” eavesdropping to be a violation of
the Fourth Amendment and therefore “presumptively unreasonable in
the absence of a search warrant.” There is no reference to any long
line of cases, but simply a citation to Silverman, and several cases
following it, to establish this historical proposition. In the first place,
as I have indicated in this opinion, I do not read Silverman as hold-
ing any such thing; and in the second place, Silverman was decided
in 1961. Thus, whatever it held, it cannot be said it “has [been] long
held.” I think my Brother Harian recognizes this later in his
opinion when he admits that the Court must now overrule Olmstead
and Goldman. In having to overrule these cases in order to estab-
lish the holding the Court adopts today, it becomes clear that the
Court is promulgating new doctrine instead of merely following what
it “has long held.” This is emphasized by my Brother Haran’s
claim that it is “bad physics” to adhere to Goldman. Such an asser-
tion simply illustrates the propensity of some members of the
Court to rely on their limited understanding of modern scientific
subjects in order to fit the Constitution to the times and give its
language a meaning that it will not tolerate.
KATZ v. UNITED STATES. 373
347 Brack, J., dissenting.

Since I see no way in which the words of the Fourth
Amendment can be construed to apply to eavesdropping,
that closes the matter for me. In interpreting the Bill
of Rights, I willingly go as far as a liberal construction
of the language takes me, but I simply cannot in good
conscience give a meaning to words which they have
never before been thought to have and which they cer-
tainly do not have in common ordinary usage. I will not
distort the words of the Amendment in order to “keep the
Constitution up to date” or “to bring it into harmony
with the times.” It was never meant that this Court
have such power, which in effect would make us a con-
tinuously functioning constitutional convention.

With this decision the Court has completed, I hope,
its rewriting of the Fourth Amendment, which started
only recently when the Court began referring incessantly
to the Fourth Amendment not so much as a law against
unreasonable searches and seizures as one to protect
an individual’s privacy. By clever word juggling the
Court finds it plausible to argue that language aimed
specifically at searches and seizures of things that can
be searched and seized may, to protect privacy, be ap-
plied to eavesdropped evidence of conversations that
can neither be searched nor seized. Few things happen
to an individual that do not affect his privacy in one
way or another. Thus, by arbitrarily substituting the
Court’s language, designed to protect privacy, for the
Constitution’s language, designed to protect against
unreasonable searches and seizures, the Court has made
the Fourth Amendment its vehicle for holding all laws
violative of the Constitution which offend the Court’s
broadest concept of privacy. As I said in Griswold v.
Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479, “The Court talks about a
constitutional ‘right of privacy’ as though there is some
constitutional provision or provisions forbidding any
law ever to be passed which might abridge the ‘privacy’

of individuals. But there is not.” (Dissenting opinion,
at 508.) I made clear in that dissent my fear of the
dangers involved when this Court uses the “broad, ab-
stract and ambiguous concept” of “privacy” as a “com-
prehensive substitute for the Fourth Amendment’s
guarantee against ‘unreasonable searches and seizures.’ ”
(See generally dissenting opinion, at 507-527.)

The Fourth Amendment protects privacy only to the
extent that it prohibits unreasonable searches and seiz-
ures of “persons, houses, papers, and effects.” No general
right is created by the Amendment so as to give this
Court the unlimited power to hold unconstitutional
everything which affects privacy. Certainly the Fram-
ers, well acquainted as they were with the excesses of
governmental power, did not intend to grant this Court
such omnipotent lawmaking authority as that. The
history of governments proves that it is dangerous to
freedom to repose such powers in courts.

For these reasons I respectfully dissent.
