(1) as matter of first impression, compel-
ling defendant to reveal password to

nature, triggering Fifth Amendment
privilege against self-incrimination;

(2

as matter of first impression, the fore-

tion of the Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination has limited
application and is inapplicable to com-
pel the disclosure of a defendant’s
password to assist the Commonwealth
in gaining access to a computer; and
(3) even if foregone conclusion exception to
the Fifth Amendment privilege against
self-incrimination could be applied to
the compulsion to reveal a computer
password, Commonwealth failed to sat-
isfy requirements of exception.

Reversed and remanded.

right is de novo, and its scope of review is

The Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination not only applies
to a defendant in a criminal trial, but in
any other proceeding, civil or criminal, for-
mal or informal, where the answers might
incriminate the speaker in future criminal
proceedings. U.S. Const. Amend. 5.

The Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination protects an ac-
cused only from being compelled to testify
against himself, or otherwise provide the
State with evidence of a testimonial or

communicative nature. U.S. Const.
Amend. 5.

4. Witnesses €=297(1)

In order to be testimonial within the
meaning of the Fifth Amendment, an ac-
cused’s communication must itself, explicit-
ly or implicitly, relate a factual assertion
or disclose information; only then is a per-
son compelled to be a witness against him-
self. U.S. Const. Amend. 5.

5. Witnesses <=297(1)

In the realm of the non-physical dis-
closure of information, the Fifth Amend-
ment privilege against self-incrimination is
broad, as compelled testimony that com-
municates information that may lead to
incriminating evidence is privileged even if
the information itself is not inculpatory;
thus, the privilege is a protection against
the prosecutor’s use of incriminating infor-
mation derived directly or indirectly from
the compelled testimony. U.S. Const.
Amend. 5.

6. Witnesses €=297(1)

Whenever a suspect is asked for a
response requiring him to communicate an
express or implied assertion of fact or
belief, the suspect confronts the “trilem-
ma” of truth, falsity, or silence, and hence
the response, whether based on truth or
falsity, contains a testimonial component
within the meaning of the Fifth Amend-
ment. U.S. Const. Amend. 5.

An act of production may be testimo-

OPINION

JUSTICE TODD

In this appeal by allowance, we consider
an issue of first impression: Whether a
defendant may be compelled to disclose a
password to allow the Commonwealth ac-
cess to the defendant’s lawfully-seized, but

1. IP addresses identify computers on the In-
ternet, enabling data transmitted from other
computers to reach them. National Cable &
Telecomm. Ass’n v. Brand X Internet Services,

encrypted, computer. For the reasons that
follow, we find that such compulsion is
violative of the Fifth Amendment to the
United States Constitution’s prohibition
against self-incrimination. Thus, we re-
verse the order of the Superior Court.

On July 14, 2014, agents of the Office of
Attorney General (“OAG”), as part of their
investigation of the electronic dissemina-
tion of child pornography, discovered that
a computer at an identified Internet Pro-
tocol (IP) address ! registered with Com-
cast Cable Communications (“Comcast”),
repeatedly utilized a peer-to-peer file-
sharing network, eMule, to share child
pornography. N.T. Hearing, 1/14/16, at 6-
8. Specifically, agents used a computer
with software designed to make a one-to-
one connection with the computer at the
aforementioned IP address and download-
ed a file, later confirmed to contain child
pornography, which was saved to the OAG
computer. Id. at 5-6. Based upon its trans-
ference and review of the file, the OAG
obtained a court order to compel Comcast
to provide subscriber information associat-
ed with the IP address. The information
provided by Comcast disclosed the sub-
scriber as Appellant Joseph Davis, as well
as his address. Jd. at 8-9.

On September 9, 2014, the OAG applied
for, received, and executed a search war-
rant at Appellant’s apartment. OAG Spe-
cial Agent Justin Leri informed Appellant
that he was not under arrest, but that the
search involved an investigation of child
pornography. Jd. at 11. Appellant was then
read his Miranda warnings and waived his
Miranda rights. Id. Appellant acknowl-
edged that he was the sole user of a Dell
computer He admitted to having prior

545 U.S. 967, 987 n.1, 125 S.Ct. 2688, 162
L.Ed.2d 820 (2005).

2. The Dell computer seized in this search is
not the subject of the Commonwealth’s mo-
538 Pa,

pornography convictions, but denied the
computer contained any illegal porno-
graphic images. Appellant then declined to
answer additional questions without a law-
yer. Id. Later examination of the computer
revealed that the hard drive had been
“wiped,” removing data entirely or render-
ing it unreadable. Id. at 43-44.

On October 4, 2015, OAG Agent Daniel
Block identified a different child pornogra-
phy video that was shared with a different
IP address utilizing the eMule server. An
administrative subpoena to Comcast re-
garding this IP address again produced
Appellant’s name and contact information.
A direct connection was made from OAG
computers to this IP address, and one
electronic file containing child pornogra-
phy was transferred to the OAG computer.
Id. at 19.

On October 20, 2015, the OAG executed
another search warrant at Appellant’s
apartment based upon this video. At Ap-
pellant’s apartment, the agents discovered
a single computer, an HP Envy 700 desk-
top. After being Mirandized, Appellant in-
formed the agents that he lived alone, that
he was the sole user of the computer, and
that he used hardwired Internet services
which are password protected, and, thus,
not accessible by the public, such as
through Wifi. Jd. at 26. Appellant offered
that only he knew the password to his
computer. Jd. Appellant also informed the
agents, inter alia, that he watched pornog-
raphy on the computer which he believed
was legal; that he had previously been
arrested for child pornography; and that
child pornography was legal in other coun-
tries so he did not understand why it was
illegal in the United States. Id. at 27-28.
The agents arrested Appellant for the eM-
ule distributions and seized his computer.
Agent Block asked Appellant for the pass-
word to this computer and Appellant re-

tion to compel a password at issue in this

220 ATLANTIC REPORTER, 3d SERIES

fused. Id. at 28. Subsequently, when in
transit to his arraignment, Appellant spoke
openly about watching various porno-
graphic movies, indicating that he particu-
larly liked watching 10, 11, 12, and 13-year
olds. Id. at 30. Agent Block again request-
ed that Appellant provide him with the
password to the computer. Appellant re-
sponded: “It’s 64 characters and why
would I give that to you? We both know
what’s on there. It’s only going to hurt me.
No f*cking way I’m going to give it to
you.” Id.

Later, in a holding cell, Agent Leri con-
versed with Appellant who, inter alia, of-
fered that he believes the “government
continuously spies on individuals,” and
questioned “why it’s illegal to ... view
movies in the privacy of [his] own home.”
Id. at 35. In a later conversation, Agent
Leri asked Appellant if he could remember
the password. Appellant replied that he
could not remember it, and that, even if he
could, it would be like “putting a gun to his
head and pulling the trigger.” Id. at 35-36.
In a subsequent visit, when asked again
about the password, Appellant offered that
“he would die in jail before he could ever
remember the password.” Id. at 37.

A supervisory agent in computer foren-
sics, Special Agent Braden Cook, testified
that a portion of Appellant’s HP 700 Envy
computer’s hard drive was encrypted with
a program called TrueCrypt Version 7.1.
Id. at 42. The entire hard drive of the
computer was encrypted and “there was
no data that could be read without opening
the TrueCrypt volume.” Jd. at 46. Agent
Cook could only confirm that there was
“Windows on the computer and the TrueC-
rypt,” and he had no knowledge of any
specific files other than the operating sys-
tem files. Id. at 50-51.

matter.
COMMONWEALTH v. DAVIS Pa.

539

Cite as 220 A.3d 534 (Pa. 2019)

Appellant was charged with two counts
of disseminating child pornography in vio-
lation of 18 Pa.C.S. § 6312(c), and two
counts of criminal use of a communication
facility in violation of 18 Pa.C.S. § 7512(a),
which arose from the July 2014 and Octo-
ber 2015 detections.

On December 17, 2015, the Common-
wealth filed with the Luzerne County
Court of Common Pleas a pre-trial motion
to compel Appellant to divulge the pass-
word to his HP 700 computer. Appellant
responded by invoking his right against
self-incrimination. On January 14, 2016,
the trial court conducted an evidentiary
hearing at which several OAG agents testi-
fied, as set forth above, about the investi-
gation supporting the seizure of the com-
puter.

The trial court focused on the question
of whether the encryption was testimonial
in nature, and, thus, protected by the Fifth
Amendment. The trial court opined that
“(t]he touchstone of whether an act of
production is testimonial is whether the
government compels the individual to use
‘the contents of his own mind’ to explicitly
or implicitly communicate some statement
of fact.” Trial Court Opinion, 6/30/2016, at
8-9 (citation omitted). As part of its analy-
sis, the trial court looked to the “foregone
conclusion” exception to the Fifth Amend-
ment privilege against self-incrimination as
articulated by the United States Supreme
Court in Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S.
391, 409, 96 S.Ct. 1569, 48 L.Ed.2d 39
(1976). The court noted the rationale un-
derlying this doctrine is that an act of
production does not involve testimonial
communication if the facts conveyed are
already known to the government, such
that the individual “ ‘adds little or nothing
to the sum total of the government’s infor-
mation.’” Trial Court Opinion, 6/30/2016,

3. The Superior Court initially considered

at 9 (quoting Fisher, 425 U.S. at 409, 96
S.Ct. 1569). The trial court offered that for
this exception to apply, the government
must establish its knowledge of (1) the
existence of the evidence demanded; (2)
the possession or control of the evidence
by the defendant; and (3) the authenticity
of the evidence. Id. at 9.

Applying the foregone conclusion excep-
tion, the trial court found that, in the case
at bar, the computer located in Appellant’s
residence had hard-wired Internet access
only; Appellant admitted it was TrueCrypt
encrypted; that he was the only user, and
he was the only one who knew the pass-
word; Appellant indicated to the agents
that “we both know what is on there,” and
stated that he would “die in prison before
giving up the password;” and that the
Commonwealth knew with a reasonable
degree of certainty that child pornography
was on the computer. Jd. at 11. Based
upon these facts, the trial court deter-
mined that the information the Common-
wealth sought from Appellant was a fore-
gone conclusion, in that the facts to be
conveyed by Appellant’s act of production
of his password already were known to the
government. As, according to the trial
court, Appellant’s revealing his password
would not provide the Commonwealth with
any new evidence, and would simply be an
act that permitted the Commonwealth to
retrieve what was already known to them,
the foregone conclusion exception was sat-
isfied. Thus, on June 30, 2016, the trial
court granted the Commonwealth’s motion
and directed Appellant to supply the Com-
monwealth with any passwords used to
access the computer within 30 days. Appel-
lant filed an interlocutory appeal.

A three-judge panel of the Superior
Court affirmed. Commonwealth v. Davis,
176 A.3d 869 (Pa. Super. 2017).? Like the

whether it had jurisdiction to entertain the
540 Pa.

trial court, the Superior Court found that,
to qualify for the Fifth Amendment privi-
lege, a communication must be testimonial.
The Superior Court observed that the
question of whether compelling an individ-
ual to provide a digital password was testi-
monial in nature was an issue of first
impression for the court. Building upon
the trial court’s analysis, the Superior
Court explained that the Fifth Amendment
right against self-incrimination is not vio-
lated when the information communicated
to the government by way of a compelled
act of production is a foregone conclusion.
The court reasoned that the foregone con-
clusion exception provides that an act of
production does not involve testimonial
communication where the facts conveyed
already are known to the government and
set forth the applicable three-prong test.
Id. at 874-75 (citing Fisher, 425 US. at
410-13, 96 S.Ct. 1569).

Applying the foregone conclusion excep-
tion, the Superior Court, contrary to the
trial court, focused on the password itself,
and reasoned that the Commonwealth es-
tablished the computer could not be
opened without the password, that the
computer belonged to Appellant and the
password was in his possession, and that
this information was “self-authenticat-
ing” — i.e., if the computer was accessible
upon entry of the password, the password
was authentic. Jd. at 876. Further, the
court noted that multiple jurisdictions have
held that the government’s knowledge of
the encrypted documents or evidence that
it sought to compel did not need to be
exact, and determined that, based on the
agents’ forensic investigation, as well as
Appellant’s own statements to the agents

trial court’s interlocutory order on appeal. In
sum, the court determined that the order sat-
isfied each of the requirements of the collater-
al order doctrine as set forth in Pa.R.A.P.
313(b). The parties do not question this deter-
mination on appeal. While the matter is juris-

220 ATLANTIC REPORTER, 3d SERIES

while in custody, there was a high proba-
bility that child pornography existed on his
computer. Thus, the Superior Court con-
cluded that the trial court did not err in
holding that the act of providing the pass-
word in question was not testimonial in
nature and that Appellant’s Fifth Amend-
ment right against self-incrimination would
not be violated by compelling him to dis-
close the password.

[1] Our Court granted allocatur to con-
sider the following issue, as framed by
Appellant:

May [Appellant] be compelled to disclose
orally the memorized password to a
computer over his invocation of privilege
under the Fifth Amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States, and Arti-
cle I, [S]ection 9 of the Pennsylvania
Constitution?

Commonwealth v. Davis, — Pa. ——, 195
A.3d 557 (2018) (order). The parameters of
our review of an issue involving a constitu-
tional right is well settled. Our standard of
review is de novo, and our scope of review
is plenary. Commonwealth v. Baldwin, 619
Pa. 178, 58 A.3d 754, 762 (2012).

Appellant argues the Fifth Amendment
prohibits government compulsion to dis-
close a computer password against one’s
will, reasoning that requiring an individual
to recall and disclose the memorized pass-
word is quintessentially testimonial, ie.,
revealing the contents of one’s own mind.
Indeed, according to Appellant, the privi-
lege is not just about information, but is
“about a core of individual autonomy into
which the state may not encroach.” Appel-
lant’s Brief at 16. Appellant maintains that,

dictional in nature, and, thus, non-waivable
and subject to sua sponte consideration by
this Court, Commonwealth v. Shearer, 584 Pa.
134, 882 A.2d 462, 465 n.4 (2005), we do not
disagree with the Superior Court’s analysis.
COMMONWEALTH v. DAVIS Pa.

541

Cite as 220 A.3d 534 (Pa. 2019)

as his password exists in his mind, he
cannot be compelled to remember the
password or reveal it, as a person’s
thoughts and knowledge are at the core of
the Fifth Amendment.

According to Appellant, the Fifth
Amendment protects against not only com-
pelled written and oral testimony, but non-
verbal acts as well. Appellant continues
that, while not at issue in this appeal, even
if the Commonwealth had obtained an or-
der compelling Appellant to physically en-
ter his password into his computer — rath-
er than forcing him to speak or write down
his password — this would still constitute
a form of written testimony and, in any
event, such a demand for action still re-
quires using the contents of his mind to
enter his password. Appellant contrasts
such compulsion with one requiring merely
physical acts, such as being required to
wear a particular shirt, provide a blood
sample, or provide a handwriting exemp-
lar, which are not testimonial in nature, as
they do not rely on the contents of one’s
mind. See Holt v. United States, 218 U.S.
245, 252-53, 31 S.Ct. 2, 54 L.Ed. 1021
(1910); Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S.
757, 761, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908
(1966); Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263,
266-67, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178
(1967). Appellant offers that providing a
password that will unlock data on a com-
puter is no different from providing a com-
bination that unlocks a briefcase or a safe,
which has been held to be testimonial in
nature.

Appellant further asserts that the Su-
preme Court’s “ ‘foregone conclusion’ ra-
tionale,” as set forth in Fisher, does not
apply to computer passwords. Appellant’s
Brief at 24. Appellant suggests that the
holding in Fisher was limited to its facts
and merely involved the question of wheth-
er the disclosure of certain tax documents
known to be in the possession of the defen-

dants’ attorneys, as agents of the defen-
dants, could be compelled by the govern-
ment. In distinguishing Fisher, Appellant
not only emphasizes that in that case the
request did not compel oral testimony, or
require restating, repeating, or affirming
the truth of the contents of the documents,
but explains that, because accountants pre-
pared the papers which were ultimately
possessed by defendants’ attorneys, and
could independently authenticate them, the
Government was not relying upon the
“truth-telling” of the defendants. Fisher,
425 USS. at 411, 96 S.Ct. 1569.

Appellant submits that, regardless of the
scope of the foregone conclusion rationale,
it is limited to the act of producing docu-
ments and that, as discussed below, the
United States Supreme Court has applied
the foregone conclusion exception only
once since Fisher, rejecting its usage in
the context of the compelled production of
business records. United States v. Hubbell,
530 U.S. 27, 120 S.Ct. 2037, 147 L.Ed.2d 24
(2000) (dismissing government’s reliance
on foregone conclusion exception, finding
that compulsion to produce papers that
would require defendant to make use of
his own mind to identify hundreds of docu-
ments responsive to the request did not
fall within the exception).

Appellant asserts that, even if the fore-
gone conclusion rationale could apply to
the compelled decryption of a computer, it
cannot be satisfied in this matter. Specifi-
cally, as to the password itself, Appellant
contends that it is not a foregone conclu-
sion that he even knows the password at
this time. Likewise, if the rationale goes to
the presence of contraband on Appellant’s
computer, which Appellant maintains that
it does, here, the OAG agents noted that
they could not tell what might be on the
confiscated computer, and, as the comput-
er was not connected to the Internet when
it was seized, there is no proof that it was
542 Pa.

the one used to share pornography on
eMule.’ Finally, Appellant adds that the
relatively few states that have considered
the decryption password issue have
reached divergent conclusions, and stress-
es that the national trend is toward great-
er protections.

The Commonwealth explains that the
Fifth Amendment, by its terms, provides
that no person shall be compelled in any
criminal case to be a witness against him-
self; thus, according to the Common-
wealth, this Amendment covers only com-
munications that are testimonial, and the
compulsion to produce physical evidence
is not protected. The Commonwealth re-
lies almost exclusively on what it de-
scribes as the foregone conclusion “doc-
trine,” as articulated in Fisher and other
decisional law. The Commonwealth sur-
veys various decisions and submits that
the majority of cases find it logical and
sound to extend the foregone conclusion
exception to providing the password to an
encrypted device. Here, according to the
Commonwealth, the compelled act is the
surrendering of the password, and the
“testimony” inherent in Appellant’s pro-
duction of the password — the existence,

4. Appellant also argues an independent basis
for protection against disclosure of the pass-
word under Article I, Section 9 of the Penn-
sylvania Constitution. Appellant engages in a
detailed analysis, offering that the text of the
Pennsylvania charter as well as the history of
the provision suggests broader protections
thereunder. The Commonwealth strongly as-
serts throughout its brief that Appellant has
waived his state constitutional law claim, and
maintains that, in any event, such claim has
no merit, stressing the numerous decisions in
which our Court has indicated the rights un-
der the sister sections are coterminous. As we
resolve this matter on federal Constitutional
grounds, we need not address the Common-
wealth’s waiver contention or Appellant’s un-
derlying assertion of the recognition of great-
er rights under the Pennsylvania Constitution.

location, and authenticity, of the pass-
word — is a foregone conclusion. In
short, the Commonwealth contends that
revealing the password will add nothing
communicative to the government’s infor-
mation as it does not disclose information
about the computer or its contents. Thus,
the Commonwealth asserts it has met its
burden in this regard.*

[2-4] Our analysis begins with the
United States Constitution. The Self-In-
crimination Clause of the Fifth Amend-
ment provides “[nJo person ... shall be
compelled in any criminal case to be a
witness against himself.” U.S. Const.
amend. V. This privilege not only applies
to a defendant in a criminal trial, but “in
any other proceeding, civil or criminal, for-
mal or informal, where the answers might
incriminate [the speaker] in future crimi-
nal proceedings.” Minnesota v. Murphy,
465 U.S. 420, 426, 104 S.Ct. 1136, 79
L.Ed.2d 409 (1984) (citation omitted). “Al-
though the text does not delineate the
ways in which a person might be made a
‘witness against himself, we have long
held that the privilege does not protect a
suspect from being compelled by the State
to produce ‘real or physical evidence.’

5. Amicus for Appellant, the Electronic Fron-
tier Foundation, stresses that compulsion to
disclose a computer password subjects an in-
dividual to a “cruel trilemma’’ — to choose
between providing the allegedly incriminating
information; lying about the purported inabil-
ity to do so; or refusing to cooperate and be
held in contempt. According to Amicus, the
privilege was designed to prevent this trilem-
ma. In a joint amicus brief in support of the
Commonwealth, various states provide an in-
teresting history of modern encryption, press
the troubling consequences of Appellant’s po-
sition — including the altering of the balance
of power, rendering law enforcement incapa-
ble of accessing large amounts of relevant
evidence — and warn that adopting Appel-
lant’s position could result in less privacy, not
more, in the form of draconian anti-privacy
legislation.

Rather, the privilege ‘protects an accused
only from being compelled to testify
against himself, or otherwise provide the
State with evidence of a testimonial or
communicative nature.” Pennsylvania v.
Muniz, 496 U.S. 582, 588-89, 110 S.Ct.
2638, 110 L.Ed.2d 528 (1990) (citations
omitted). As offered by Justice Oliver
Wendell Holmes, “the prohibition of com-
pelling a man in criminal court to be wit-
ness against himself is a prohibition of the
use of physical or moral compulsion to
extort communications from him, not an
exclusion of his body as evidence when it
may be material.” Holt, 218 U.S. at 252-53,
31 S.Ct. 2. Indeed, “in order to be testimo-
nial, an accused’s communication must it-
self, explicitly or implicitly, relate a factual
assertion or disclose information. Only
then is a person compelled to be a ‘witness’
against himself.” Doe v. United States, 487
US. 201, 210, 108 S.Ct. 2341, 101 L.Ed.2d
184 (1988) (“Doe II”) (footnote omitted).

[5] However, in the realm of the non-
physical disclosure of information, the
privilege is broad, as “compelled testimony
that communicates information that may
‘lead to incriminating evidence’ is privi-
leged even if the information itself is not
inculpatory.” Id., 487 U.S. at 208 n.6, 108
S.Ct. 2341. Thus, it is a “protection against
the prosecutor’s use of incriminating infor-
mation derived directly or indirectly from
the compelled testimony.” Hubbell, 530
US. at 38, 120 S.Ct. 2037.

[6] The primary policy undergirding
the Fifth Amendment privilege against
self-incrimination is our country’s “fierce
‘unwillingness to subject those suspected
of crime to the cruel trilemma of self-
accusation, perjury or contempt’ that de-
fined the operation of the Star Chamber,
wherein suspects were forced to choose
between revealing incriminating private
thoughts and forsaking their oath by com-
mitting perjury.” Muniz, 496 U.S. at 596,

110 S.Ct. 2638 (quoting Doe II, 487 U.S. at
212, 108 S.Ct. 2341). This being the case,
“the definition of ‘testimonial’ evidence ar-
ticulated in Doe must encompass all re-
sponses to questions that, if asked of a
sworn suspect during a criminal trial,
could place the suspect in the ‘cruel trilem-
ma.’” Id. at 597, 110 S.Ct. 2638. As the
Supreme Court reasoned, “[t]his conclu-
sion is consistent with our recognition in
Doe that ‘(t]he vast majority of verbal
statements thus will be testimonial’ be-
cause ‘[t]here are very few instances in
which a verbal statement, either oral or
written, will not convey information or as-
sert facts.’” Id. Thus, “[w]henever a sus-
pect is asked for a response requiring him
to communicate an express or implied as-
sertion of fact or belief, the suspect con-
fronts the ‘trilemma’ of truth, falsity, or
silence, and hence the response (whether
based on truth or falsity) contains a testi-
monial component.” Jd. (footnote omitted).

[7] To invoke the Fifth Amendment
privilege against the forced provision of
information, a defendant must show (1) the
evidence is self-incriminating; (2) the evi-
dence is compelled; and (3) the evidence is
testimonial in nature. Hubbell, 530 U.S. at
34, 120 S.Ct. 2037. Thus, the government
may not force someone to provide an in-
criminating communication that is “testi-
monial” in nature. It is only this last re-
quirement — whether the evidence sought
to be compelled is testimonial — that is at
issue in this appeal.

The United States Supreme Court has
not rendered a decision directly addressing
whether compelling a person to disclose a
computer password is testimonial. In a
series of foundational, but somewhat com-
plex, cases, however, the high Court has
discussed whether the act of production of
documents may be testimonial for pur-
poses of the Fifth Amendment.
544 Pa.

In Fisher, the high Court examined the
question of what acts of production were
testimonial in nature. Fisher involved
consolidated cases in which the Internal
Revenue Service (“IRS”) sought to obtain
voluntarily-prepared documents the de-
fendant taxpayers had given to their at-
torneys. The IRS issued summonses on
the defendant taxpayers’ attorneys to
produce the documents which included ac-
countants’ work papers, copies of the de-
fendant taxpayers’ returns, and copies of
other reports and correspondence. The
attorneys responded that producing the
documents would violate their clients’
rights against self-incrimination, after
which the IRS brought an enforcement
action.

Ultimately, the Supreme Court, after re-
jecting the attorneys’ argument that the
Fifth Amendment protected them from be-
ing compelled to produce the documents,
determined that the Fifth Amendment
privilege was applicable where defendant
taxpayers were required to produce in-
criminating evidence, and that the act of
producing even unprivileged evidence
could have communicative aspects render-
ing it testimonial and entitled to Fifth
Amendment protection. Fisher, 425 U.S. at
409-10, 96 S.Ct. 1569. Under the facts in
Fisher, the Court found that the govern-
ment was not relying on the “truth-telling”
of the defendant taxpayers to establish the
existence of the documents, their access to
them, or their authentication of them, as
they had been produced by accountants,
and not the defendant taxpayers them-
selves. Id. at 411, 96 S.Ct. 1569. Thus, the
Court concluded that the act of producing
the subpoenaed documents did not involve
self-incriminating testimony.

This analysis served as the basis of the
foregone conclusion exception to the Fifth
Amendment, discussed below. The Court
offered that, because the existence, loca-

220 ATLANTIC REPORTER, 3d SERIES

tion, and authenticity of the documents
sought was known to the government, the
Fifth Amendment privilege was rendered
inapplicable. The Court explained that
“t]he existence and location of the papers
are a foregone conclusion and the taxpayer
adds little or nothing to the sum total of
the Government’s information by conced-
ing that he in fact has the papers.” Id.
Thus, the Court reasoned that the defen-
dant taxpayers’ production of the docu-
ments was non-testimonial because the
government knew of the existence of the
documents, that the defendant taxpayers
possessed the documents, and that the
government could show their authentici-
ty — not through the use of the defendant
taxpayers’ minds, but through the testimo-
ny of others. Thus, the Fifth Amendment
privilege did not apply to the third-party
production of documents requested. Id. at
414, 96 S.Ct. 1569.

Almost a decade later, in United States
v. Doe, 465 U.S. 605, 104 S.Ct. 1237, 79
L.Ed.2d 552 (1984) (“Doe I”), the Court
considered a Fifth Amendment challenge
to a subpoena that did not seek specific,
known files, but broad categories of gen-
eral business records of a sole propri-
etorship. The Court found that, while the
contents of the documents were not privi-
leged, the act of producing the business
documents could have testimonial aspects
and an incriminating effect. The Court
opined that the enforcement of the sub-
poena would compel the defendant to ad-
mit that the records existed, that they
were in his possession, and that they
were authentic, which was sufficient to
establish a valid claim of privilege
against self-incrimination. While conclud-
ing that, by producing the documents,
the defendant would relieve the govern-
ment of the need for authentication, the
Court mentioned (although did not apply)
the foregone conclusion analysis: “This is
not to say that the Government was fore-
COMMONWEALTH v. DAVIS Pa.

545

Cite as 220 A.3d 534 (Pa. 2019)

closed from rebutting respondent’s claim
by producing evidence that possession,
existence, and authentication were a
‘foregone conclusion.’ In this case,
however, the Government failed to make
such a showing.” Jd. at 614 n.13, 104
S.Ct. 1237 (citation omitted).

In a subsequent, unrelated, decision in
Doe II, the high Court considered the
legality of an order compelling the target
of a grand jury investigation to authorize
foreign banks to disclose records of his
accounts. 487 U.S. at 202, 108 S.Ct. 2341.
The defendant contended that compelling
him to sign the bank consent form would
provide the government with incriminating
records that would otherwise be unavail-
able, as the court had no power to order
foreign banks to produce records. Id. at
204, 108 S.Ct. 2341. In rejecting this con-
tention, the high Court indicated that “an
accused’s communication must itself, ex-
plicitly or implicitly, relate a factual asser-
tion or disclose information.” Jd. at 210,
108 S.Ct. 2341. The Court reasoned that
the written authorization did not have tes-
timonial significance, as it did not commu-
nicate any factual assertion, implicit or
explicit, or convey any information to the
government.

Importantly, for purposes of the issue
before us, in response to a dissent by
Justice John Paul Stevens, wherein he
would have found the Fifth Amendment
gave the defendant the right to refuse to
sign the consent authorizing access to his
bank accounts on the basis that he was
compelled to use his mind as a witness
against himself, the majority first agreed
with the dissent by acknowledging that
“(t]he expression of the contents of an
individual’s mind” is testimonial communi-
cation for purposes of the Fifth Amend-
ment. Jd. at 210 n.9, 108 S.Ct. 2341. Thus,
the Court was unanimous in its holding on
this issue. The majority continued, howev-

er, that “[w]e simply disagree with the
dissent’s conclusion that the execution of
the consent directive at issue here forced
petitioner to express the contents of his
mind. In our view, such compulsion is
more like ‘befing] forced to surrender a
key to a strongbox containing incrimina-
ting documents’ than it is like ‘be[ing]
compelled to reveal the combination to
[petitioner's] wall safe.’” Id. (quoting Ste-
vens, J. dissenting, 487 U.S. at 219, 108
S.Ct. 2341) (emphasis added). Thus, the
Court emphasized a clear physical/mental
distinction in the context of a foregone
conclusion analysis.

Another decade later, the Court in Hub-
bell again spoke to testimonial evidence in
the business record context. In that case,
Webster Hubbell, as part of the “Whitewa-
ter” investigation by Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr during the presidency of
Bill Clinton, had pleaded guilty to charges
of mail fraud and tax evasion arising out of
his billing practices. In the plea agree-
ment, Hubbell promised to provide the
Independent Counsel with “full, complete,
accurate, and truthful information” about
matters relating to the Whitewater investi-
gation. Hubbell, 530 U.S. at 30, 120 S.Ct.
2037. Later, while Hubbell was in prison, a
grand jury investigating the activities of
the Whitewater Development Corporation,
issued a subpoena demanding from Hub-
bell the production of eleven categories of
documents. Jd. at 31, 120 S.Ct. 2037. Hub-
bell invoked his Fifth Amendment privi-
lege. The Independent Counsel then ob-
tained an order from the federal district
court directing Hubbell to comply with the
subpoena and granting him immunity
against the government’s use and deriva-
tive use of the compelled testimony. Hub-
bell then delivered 13,120 pages of the
specified documents, after which the grand
jury returned an indictment against Hub-
bell for various wire fraud, mail fraud, and
tax crimes. In response, Hubbell asserted
546 Pa.

his right against self-incrimination and a
violation of the immunity previously grant-
ed. The district court dismissed this new
indictment, but the United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Cir-
cuit reversed, and the Supreme Court
granted certiorari.

Citing Fisher, the Supreme Court reit-
erated that “a person may be required to
produce specific documents even though
they contain incriminating assertions of
fact or belief because the creation of those
documents was not ‘compelled’ within the
meaning of the privilege.” Jd. at 35-36, 120
S.Ct. 2037. Accordingly, the simple fact
that the documents contained incrimina-
ting evidence did not mean that Hubbell
could avoid complying with the subpoena.

Importantly, however, the Court reaf-
firmed that the very act of producing docu-
ments in response to a subpoena may have
a compelled testimonial aspect in and of
itself: “The ‘compelled testimony’ that is
relevant ... is not to be found in the
contents of the documents produced in re-
sponse to the subpoena. It is, rather, the
testimony inherent in the act of producing
those documents.” Jd. at 40, 120 S.Ct.
2037. (emphasis added.) Noting that in
Fisher, the government already knew that
the documents were in the attorneys’ pos-
session and could independently confirm
their existence and authenticity through
the accountants, the Hubbell Court never-
theless found that the government had not
shown it had prior knowledge of the exis-
tence or whereabouts of the documents
produced by Hubbell. Moreover, in reject-
ing the government’s assertion that its
possession of the documents was the result
of the physical act of producing the docu-
ments, the Court explained that it was
Hubbell’s responses that had provided the
government with this information, and that
it was “unquestionably necessary for [Hub-
bell] to make extensive use of ‘the contents

220 ATLANTIC REPORTER, 3d SERIES

of his own mind’ in identifying the hun-
dreds of documents responsive to the re-
quests in the subpoena.” Jd. at 48, 120
S.Ct. 2037. Indeed, in discussing the gov-
ernment’s subpoena, which had required
Hubbell to provide numerous responses to
very broad requests, the Court, harkening
back to the Doe IJ distinction, made clear
that “[t]he assembly of those documents
was like telling an inquisitor the combina-
tion to a wall safe, not like being forced to
surrender the key to a strongbox.” Jd. at
43, 120 S.Ct. 2037 (citation omitted).

The Court then considered whether the
act of producing the records was sufficient-
ly testimonial because the existence and
possession of such records was a foregone
conclusion. The Court held that “[w]hatev-
er the scope of this ‘foregone conclusion’
rationale,” it did not apply to overcome the
testimonial aspects of Hubbell’s production
of documents because the government did
not have prior knowledge of the existence
or location of the documents. Id. at 44-45,
120 S.Ct. 2037. Thus, the Court concluded
that the Fifth Amendment privilege ap-
plied, and that Hubbell’s act of production
of the documents had testimonial aspects,
at least regarding the existence and loca-
tion of the documents, which was not over-
come by being a foregone conclusion. Jd. at
45, 120 S.Ct. 2037.

Finally, the Supreme Court’s decision in
Muniz informs our analysis. Muniz, after
failing field sobriety tests, was arrested for
driving while intoxicated, and asked vari-
ous questions when he was being booked.
496 U.S. at 585-86, 110 S.Ct. 2638. Specifi-
cally, the defendant was asked, inter alia,
for identifying information such as his
name, address, and date of birth, along
with the date of his sixth birthday. The
high Court considered the issue of whether
the defendant’s statements during the
booking process were testimonial, and,
thus, subject to the Fifth Amendment priv-
COMMONWEALTH v. DAVIS Pa.

547

Cite as 220 A.3d 534 (Pa. 2019)

ilege against self-incrimination, which was
implicated because the defendant had not
been provided with Miranda warnings. Id.
at 589-90, 110 S.Ct. 2638. The Court held
that descriptions by police of the defen-
dant’s speech as “slurred,” although in-
criminating, were not testimonial, but akin
to other physical characteristics that do
not enjoy Fifth Amendment protection. Id.
at 590-91, 110 S.Ct. 2638. However, the
substance of the defendant’s answers, spe-
cifically involving his birthday, were held
to be testimonial. The Muniz Court em-
phasized that the Fifth Amendment spares
an accused from “having to reveal, directly
or indirectly, his knowledge of facts relat-
ing him to the offense or from having to
share this thoughts and beliefs with the
Government.” Id. at 595, 110 S.Ct. 2638
(citation omitted). Moreover, the Court
reasoned that when the defendant was
asked about his birthday, he had to admit
that he did not know, or answer untruth-
fully, raising the specter of the “cruel tri-
lemma.” Jd. at 596, 110 S.Ct. 2638. This,
according to the Court, was entirely con-
sistent with the Court’s prior admonition
that “[t]he vast majority of verbal state-
ments thus will be testimonial” because
they likely “convey information or assert
facts.” Id., 496 U.S. at 597, 110 S.Ct. 2638
(quoting Doe II, 487 U.S. at 213, 108 S.Ct.
2341). Thus, the testimonial statements re-
vealing the contents of the defendant’s own
mind disclosed consciousness of fact sub-
ject to the privilege.

[8,9] From this foundational law noted
above, we can distill certain guiding princi-
ples. First, the Supreme Court has made,
and continues to make, a distinction be-
tween physical production and testimonial
production. As made clear by the Court,
where the government compels a physical
act, such production is not testimonial, and
the privilege is not recognized. See Holt;
Doe II, Second, an act of production, how-

ever, may be testimonial when the act
expresses some explicit or implicit state-
ment of fact that certain materials exist,
are in the defendant’s custody or control,
or are authentic. See Fisher; Hubbell. The
crux of whether an act of production is
testimonial is whether the government
compels the defendant to use the “contents
of his own mind” in explicitly or implicitly
communicating a fact. See Doe II; Hubbell.
Third, and broadly speaking, the high
Court has recognized that the vast majori-
ty of compelled oral statements of facts
will be considered testimonial, as they con-
vey information or assert facts. See Muniz;
Doe II. This is consistent with the Court’s
deep concern regarding placing a suspect
in the “cruel trilemma” of telling the truth,
lying and perjuring himself, or refusing to
answer and facing contempt and jail. Id.
Indeed, the Court has unanimously con-
cluded that “[t]he expression of the con-
tents of an individual’s mind” is testimonial
communication for purposes of the Fifth
Amendment. Doe II, 487 U.S. at 210 n.9,
108 S.Ct. 2341.

Finally, and consistent with this histori-
cal repulsion of the prospect of compelling
a defendant to reveal his or her mental
impressions, we find it particularly reveal-
ing that, when addressing Justice Ste-
vens’s dissent in Doe IJ, the majority of
the Court noted that compelling the defen-
dant to sign the bank disclosure forms was
more akin to “be[ing] forced to surrender
a key to a strongbox containing incrimina-
ting documents” than it was to “befing]
compelled to reveal the combination to [pe-
titioner’s] wall safe.” Zd., at 210 n.9, 108
S.Ct. 2341. This is a critical distinction.
Consistent with a physical/mental produc-
tion dichotomy, in conveying the combina-
tion to a wall safe, versus surrendering a
key to a strongbox, a person must use the
“contents of [their] own mind.” If one is
protected from telling an inquisitor the
combination to a wall safe, it is a short
548 Pa.

step to conclude that one is protected from
telling an inquisitor the password to a
computer.

[10,11] Based upon these cases ren-
dered by the United States Supreme
Court regarding the scope of the Fifth
Amendment, we conclude that compelling
the disclosure of a password to a comput-
er, that is, the act of production, is testi-
monial. Distilled to its essence, the reveal-
ing of a computer password is a verbal
communication, not merely a physical act
that would be nontestimonial in nature.
There is no physical manifestation of a
password, unlike a handwriting sample,
blood draw, or a voice exemplar. As a
passcode is necessarily memorized, one
cannot reveal a passcode without revealing
the contents of one’s mind. Indeed, a pass-
word to a computer is, by its nature, inten-
tionally personalized and so unique as to
accomplish its intended purpose — keep-
ing information contained therein confiden-
tial and insulated from discovery. Here,
under United States Supreme Court prec-
edent, we find that the Commonwealth is
seeking the electronic equivalent to a com-
bination to a wall safe — the passcode to
unlock Appellant’s computer. The Com-
monwealth is seeking the password, not as
an end, but as a pathway to the files being
withheld. As such, the compelled produc-
tion of the computer’s password demands
the recall of the contents of Appellant’s
mind, and the act of production carries
with it the implied factual assertions that
will be used to incriminate him. Thus, we
hold that compelling Appellant to reveal a
password to a computer is testimonial in
nature.

6. In this regard, we reject the Common-
wealth’s seemingly newly-raised contention
that there might be a slip of paper containing
the password which would be covered by the
trial court’s order, Commonwealth’s Brief at

220 ATLANTIC REPORTER, 3d SERIES

Numerous other courts have come to
similar conclusions. See, e.g., In re Grand
Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated
March 25, 2011, 670 F.3d 1335, 1346 (11th
Cir. 2012) (holding “the decryption and
production of the hard drives would re-
quire the use of the contents of Doe’s mind
and could not be fairly characterized as a
physical act that would be nontestimonial
in nature,” thus Fifth Amendment protec-
tions were triggered); United States v.
Kirschner, 823 F.Supp.2d 665 (E.D. Mich.
2010) (finding the government could not
compel the defendant to reveal his pass-
word because this amounted to “testimo-
ny” from him which would “requir[e] him
to divulge through his mental processes
his password”).$

[12] This, however, does not end our
analysis. As noted above, the United
States Supreme Court has found informa-
tion, otherwise testimonial in nature, to be
unprotected where the production of such
information is a foregone conclusion. In
essence, this judicial toleration of certain
compelled testimony renders otherwise
privileged testimonial communication non-
testimonial. Specifically, under a foregone
conclusion analysis, the Supreme Court
has reasoned that an act of production
does not render communication testimonial
where the facts conveyed already are
known to the government such that the
evidence sought “adds little or nothing to
the sum total of the Government’s infor-
mation.” Fisher, 425 U.S. at 411, 96 S.Ct.
1569. Thus, what is otherwise testimonial
in nature is rendered nontestimonial, as
the facts sought to be compelled are a
foregone conclusion. As described above,
for the exception to apply, the government
must establish its knowledge of: (1) the

ceedings in this matter that such a paper
exists, and this case has proceeded under the
assumption of an oral or written compulsion
of Appellant to provide the password.

existence of the evidence demanded; (2)
the possession or control of the evidence
by the defendant; and (3) the authenticity
of the evidence.

Based upon the United States Supreme
Court’s jurisprudence surveyed above, it
becomes evident that the foregone conclu-
sion gloss on a Fifth Amendment analysis
constitutes an extremely limited exception
to the Fifth Amendment privilege against
self-incrimination. The Supreme Court has
spoken to this exception on few occasions
over the 40 years since its recognition in
Fisher, and its application has been consid-
ered only in the compulsion of specific
existing business or financial records. See
Doe I; Doe II; Hubbell. Its circumscribed
application is for good reason. First, the
Fifth Amendment privilege is foundational.
Any exception thereto must be necessarily
limited in scope and nature. Moreover,
business and financial records are a unique
category of material that has been subject
to compelled production and inspection by
the government for over a century. See,
eg., Shapiro v. United States, 335 U.S. 1,
33, 68 S.Ct. 1375, 92 L.Ed. 1787 (1948).
The high Court has never applied or con-
sidered the foregone conclusion exception
beyond these types of documents. Indeed,
it would be a significant expansion of the
foregone conclusion rationale to apply it to
a defendant’s compelled oral or written
testimony. As stated by the Supreme
Court, “[t]he essence of this basic constitu-
tional principle is ‘the requirement that the
[s]tate which proposes to convict and pun-
ish an individual produce the evidence
against him by the independent labor of its
officers, not by the simple cruel expedient
of forcing it from his own lips.’” Estelle v.
Smith, 451 U.S. 454, 462, 101 S.Ct. 1866,
68 L.Ed.2d 359 (1981) (emphasis original).
Broadly circumventing this principle would
undercut this foundational right.

The Court’s decisions have been ambigu-
ous concerning the breadth of the rationale
as well as its value. See Hubbell, 530 U.S.
at 44, 120 S.Ct. 2037 (“Whatever the scope
of this ‘foregone conclusion’  ratio-
nale....”); Fisher, 425 U.S. at 411, 96
S.Ct. 1569 (finding that to succeed, the
government must show that the sought
after information is a “foregone conclu-
sion” in that it “adds little or nothing to
the sum total of the Government’s infor-
mation.”) Thus, generally speaking, the ex-
ception to a large degree appears to be
intentionally superfluous; hence, the ac-
commodation to the government is of limit-
ed value. Accordingly, by definition, appli-
cation of the foregone conclusion analysis
in any given case will not be fatal to the
government’s prosecution.

 

 

Finally, the prohibition of application of
the foregone conclusion rationale to areas
of compulsion of one’s mental processes
would be entirely consistent with the Su-
preme Court decisions, surveyed above,
which uniformly protect information ar-
rived at as a result of using one’s mind. To
broadly read the foregone conclusion ratio-
nale otherwise would be to undercut these
pronouncements by the high Court. See
Doe II; Hubbell; Muniz. When comparing
the modest value of this exception to one’s
significant Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination, we believe cir-
cumscribed application of the privilege is
in order.

We acknowledge that, at times, constitu-
tional privileges are an impediment to the
Commonwealth. Requiring the Common-
wealth to do the heavy lifting, indeed, to
shoulder the entire load, in building and
bringing a criminal case without a defen-
dant’s assistance may be inconvenient and
even difficult; yet, to apply the foregone
conclusion rationale in these circumstances
would allow the exception to swallow the
constitutional privilege. Nevertheless, this
550. Pa.

constitutional right is firmly grounded in
the “realization that the privilege, while
sometimes ‘a shelter to the guilty,’ is often
‘a protection to the innocent.’” Doe II, 487
U.S. at 213, 108 S.Ct. 2341. Moreover,
there are serious questions about applying
the foregone conclusion exception to infor-
mation that manifests through the usage of
one’s mind. As expressed by the California
Court of Appeals in a matter involving an
order compelling the production of a weap-
on allegedly used in a crime:
Implicit in the prosecution’s position,
and the court’s order, is the argument
that independent evidence establishes
defendant’s possession of the gun at the
time of the offense and after.... The
Commonwealth does not simply assert
that the evidence to be gained by pro-
duction is here inconsequential or nonin-
criminating; rather it says that the evi-
dence is unworthy of Fifth Amendment
protection because it merely enhances
other persuasive evidence obtained with-
out the defendant’s help. The Common-
wealth’s argument is indeed curious. It
is as if we were asked to rule that a
confession could be coerced from an ac-
cused as soon as the government an-
nounced (or was able to show) that [in]
a future trial it could produce enough
independent evidence to get past a mo-
tion for a directed verdict of acquittal.

7. Because we are dealing with a motion to
require an individual to recall and disclose a
memorized password to a computer, in es-
sence, revealing the contents of one’s own
mind, we need not address the related, but
distinct, area involving biometric features like
fingerprints, thumbprints, iris scanning, and
facial recognition, or whether the foregone
conclusion rationale would be appropriate in
these circumstances. The dissent, however,
makes much of the potential for inconsistent
results in ‘future cases”’ involving these types
of biometric passwords. Dissenting Opinion at
556-57. Yet, not only are these communica-
tions not before our Court, it is the United
States Supreme Court that long ago has creat-
ed the dichotomy between physical and men-

App. 3d 76, 87 n.12, 199 Cal.Rptr. 366
(1984) (quotations and citations omitted)
(emphasis added).

We appreciate the significant and ever-
increasing difficulties faced by law enforce-
ment in light of rapidly changing technolo-
gy, including encryption, to obtain evi-
dence. However, unlike the documentary
requests under the foregone conclusion ra-
tionale, or demands for physical evidence
such as blood, or handwriting or voice
exemplars, information in one’s mind to
“unlock the safe” to potentially incrimina-
ting information does not easily fall within
this exception.’ Indeed, we conclude the
compulsion of a password to a computer
cannot fit within this exception.

[13,14] Thus, we hold that the com-
pelled recollection of Appellant’s password
is testimonial in nature, and, consequently,
privileged under the Fifth Amendment to
the United States Constitution. Further-
more, until the United States Supreme
Court holds otherwise, we construe the
foregone conclusion rationale to be one of
limited application, and, consistent with its
teachings in other decisions, believe the
exception to be inapplicable to compel the
disclosure of a defendant’s password to
assist the Commonwealth in gaining access

tal communication. See Holt, 218 U.S. at 252-
53, 31 S.Ct. 2 (‘the prohibition of compelling
a man in criminal court to be witness against
himself is a prohibition of the use of physical
or moral compulsion to extort communica-
tions from him, not an exclusion of his body
as evidence when it may be material.’’); Doe
II, 487 U.S. at 210 n.9, 108 S.Ct. 2341. (find-
ing the expression ‘‘more like ‘be[ing] forced
to surrender a key to a strong box containing
incriminating documents’ than it is like
be[ing] compelled to reveal the combination
to [petitioner’s] wall safe.”’).

mission and now grant the Commonwealth's
Motion for Leave to File Response to Post-
Argument Submission with respect to this is-
sue. However, as we resolve this matter in
favor of Appellant exclusively under the Fifth
Amendment to the United States Constitution,
we need not address his additional contention
that the Pennsylvania Constitution provides
greater protections than the federal charter.

9. Even if we were to find that the foregone
conclusion exception could apply to the com-
pulsion to reveal a computer password, we
nevertheless would conclude that the Com-
monwealth has not satisfied the requirements
of the exception in this matter. As noted
above, for the compelled evidence to fall with-
in the exception, the Commonwealth must
establish: (1) the existence of the evidence
demanded; (2) the possession or control of the
evidence by the defendant; and (3) the au-
thenticity of the evidence.

As the Superior Court recounted below,
there is a high probability that child pornog-
raphy exists on Appellant’s computer, as evi-
denced by: Appellant’s IP address utilizing a
peer-to-peer file sharing network to share vid-
eos depicting child pornography; the fact that
the sole computer seized had hardwire Inter-
net; and the fact that Appellant “implied as to
the nefarious contents of the computer on
numerous occasions.” Davis, 176 A.3d at 876.
However, for the exception to apply, the facts
sought to be compelled must be already
known to the Commonwealth. It is not merely
access to the computer that the Common-
wealth seeks to obtain through compelling
Appellant to divulge his computer password,
but all of the files on Appellant’s computer.
The password is merely a means to get to the
computer’s contents. While it is conceivable,
and indeed, likely, that a single video contain-
ing child pornography (as previously viewed
by the OAG agents) may be on the computer,
the compelled revelation of the password
could lead to a trove of a presently unknown
number of files. Indeed, the record establishes
that the entire hard drive of the computer was
encrypted and “there was no data that could
be read without opening the TrueCrypt vol-
ume.” N.T. Hearing, 1/14/16, at 46. Agent
Cook could only confirm that there was ‘“Win-
dows on the computer and the TrueCrypt,”
and he had no knowledge of any specific files
other than the operating system files. Id. at
50-51.

In sum, because the Commonwealth has
failed to establish that its search is limited to
the single previously identified file, and has

 

not asserted that it is a foregone conclusion as
to the existence of additional files that may be
on the computer, which would be accessible
to the Commonwealth upon Appellant's com-
pelled disclosure of the password, we find the
Commonwealth has not satisfied the foregone
conclusion exception.

10. The dissent agrees that the information the
Commonwealth seeks to compel is testimonial
in nature. Dissenting Opinion at 553. The
dissent, however, contends that, in these cir-
cumstances, governmentally forced testimony
involving a computer password falls within
the foregone conclusion exception to the Fifth
Amendment privilege against self-incrimina-
tion. Respectfully, the dissent’s position is un-
persuasive.

Initially, the dissent broadly dilutes the his-
toric and contextual underpinnings of the ap-
plication of the foregone conclusion excep-
tion, which, as noted above, constitutes an
extremely narrow exception. Indeed, the high
Court has found the exception to have been
satisfied only one time in the over 40 years
since it was created; moreover, the excep-
tion’s provenance is exclusively in cases in-
volving subpoenaed paper documents — nev-
er in the context of oral testimony. Thus,
application of the foregone conclusion excep-
tion outside of this narrow context is dubious
at best. For that reason, we will not apply the
foregone conclusion exclusion in the absence
express guidance from the high Court.

Furthermore, the dissent adopts a minority
interpretation of that exception which focuses
on the password itself, rather than on the
underlying files. Yet, even employing this
password-centric approach, the  circum-
stances, sub judice, do not satisfy the foregone
conclusion doctrine. As set forth above, and
noted by the dissent, to satisfy the foregone
conclusion doctrine, the government must es-
tablish, inter alia, the authenticity of the evi-
dence, ie., the password, with reasonable
particularity. Of course, here, the Common-
wealth cannot establish with reasonable par-
ticularity the authenticity of the password.
Rather, authenticity may only be established
after the information — the password — is
turned over to the Commonwealth. The dis-
sent is turning the authenticity requirement
on its head, allowing the Commonwealth to
satisfy its burden by, in essence, saying, “Turn
over the facts we want, and we will tell you if
it is authentic or not.”’ Of course, this is not
how the exception works. Rather, the burden
is on the Commonwealth to establish its inde-
552 Pa.

For the above-stated reasons, we re-
verse the order of the Superior Court and
remand the matter to the Superior Court,
for remand to the trial court, for proceed-
ings consistent with our Opinion.

logic was recently rejected by the Third Dis-
trict Court of Appeal of Florida in Pollard v.
State, So.3d , 2019 WL 2528776 (Fla.
Dist. Ct. App. June 20, 2019), where the court
forcefully explained the logical shortcomings
of this approach:

to passwords because all password-protect-
ed cellphones have an “authentic” pass-
word, making the [State v. Stahl, 206 So.3d

tic. 206 So.3d at 136, which begs the ques-
tion of whether sufficient evidence estab-
lished that the passcode is authentic before
it had been compelled and used successful-
ly. The state must have sufficient proof of
authenticity before it can compel the pass-
word’s production; simply because a com-
pelled password unlocks a cellphone after
the fact doesn’t make it authentic ex ante.

To do otherwise is “‘like telling an inquisitor

220 ATLANTIC REPORTER, 3d SERIES

JUSTICE BARR, Dissenting

I respectfully dissent from the majori-
ty’s decision, which holds that the foregone
conclusion exception to the Fifth Amend-
ment privilege against self-incrimination
does not apply to the compelled disclosure
of a computer password because the pass-
word manifests from one’s mind. I further
disagree with the majority’s alternative
holding that if the foregone conclusion ex-
ception would apply under the circum-
stances presented, the Commonwealth

sum total of the Government's information.”
Fisher, 425 U.S. at 411, 96 S.Ct. 1569. Noth-
ing could be farther from the case here, as the
password which the Commonwealth seeks to
compel could disclose a vast swath of files of
which the Commonwealth, it appears, cur-
rently has no knowledge.

Finally, and directly related thereto, the dis-
sent gives scant attention or significance to
the Supreme Court’s consistent approach that
revealing the contents of one’s mind is pro-
tected by the Fifth Amendment. This unmis-
takable overarching jurisprudential theme has
been consistently applied in all of the high
Court’s decisions in this area. Doe IT; Hubbell;
Muniz. Indeed, the dissent speaks volumes by
reducing to a footnote, without analysis, its
mention of the United States Supreme Court's
distinction between the production of docu-
ments and the forced compulsion of mental
processes such as the combination to a safe,
which, in the high Court’s view, plainly vio-
lates the Fifth Amendment. Doe IJ; Hubbell.
Simply stated, there is no meaningful distinc-
tion between the government compelling a
suspect to provide the combination to access
a safe, and the government forcing one to
disclose a password to access a computer.
Here, it is unquestionably necessary for Ap-
pellant to make use of “the contents of his
own mind” in providing the password. In
essence, the dissent’s approach is effectively
the same as compelling Appellant to affirm
that, “I know the password, this is my com-
puter, I have knowledge of the existence and
location of incriminating files, and I have the
capability to decrypt the files.” To accept the
dissent’s position is to embrace a stance con-
trary to the foundational privilege against the
probing of an individual’s mind to compel
communication that is incriminating.

failed to satisfy the requisites thereof be-
cause it did not establish that it had knowl-
edge of the various files stored on Appel-
lant’s computer hard drive in addition to
the single previously identified file that
contained child pornography.

Preliminarily, I acknowledge that the
issue presented in this appeal is one of
first impression, with which courts across
the nation have struggled. See generally
Marjorie A. Shields, Fifth Amendment
Privilege Against Self-Incrimination as
Applied to Compelled Disclosure of Pass-
word or Production of Otherwise E'ncrypt-
ed Electronically Stored Data, 84 A.L.R.
6th 251 (2019) (compiling Fifth Amend-
ment cases involving “compelled disclosure
of an individual’s password, means of de-
eryption, or unencrypted copy of electroni-
cally stored data”). Upon review of the
High Court’s seminal decision in Fisher v.
United States, 425 U.S. 391, 96 S.Ct. 1569,
48 L.Ed.2d 39 (1976), which first recog-
nized the foregone conclusion exception,
and its progeny, I would hold that the
foregone conclusion analysis applies to the
compelled disclosure of a password to an
electronic device, which the Common-
wealth has seized pursuant to a warrant.

My analysis focuses on the compulsion
order, which directed Appellant to “supply
the Commonwealth with any and all pass-
words used to access” a specific desktop
computer and hard drive seized from his
residence. Trial Court Order, 6/30/2016. In
my view, this order compels an act of
production that has testimonial aspects in
that it conveys, as a factual matter, that
Appellant has access to the particular com-
puter seized by the Commonwealth pursu-
ant to a warrant, and that he has posses-
sion and control over the password that
will decrypt the encrypted files stored on
that computer. As discussed in detail infra,
because the Commonwealth was already
aware of these facts based upon its own

investigation and Appellant’s candid dis-
cussion with government agents, the pass-
word falls within the foregone conclusion
exception to the Fifth Amendment privi-
lege against self-incrimination, and may be
constitutionally compelled. Notably, critical
to my position is the recognition that this
case does not involve a Fourth Amend-
ment challenge based upon Appellant’s pri-
vacy rights in his encrypted computer files
but, rather, solely a challenge to the com-
pelled disclosure of his password based
upon his Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination.

I. The Fifth Amendment As Applied
To Acts of Production

As noted by the majority, the Fifth
Amendment provides, in relevant part,
that “[nJo person ... shall be compelled in
any criminal case to be a witness against
himself.” U.S. Const. amend V. Courts
have interpreted the privilege as protect-
ing a citizen “from being compelled to
testify against himself, or otherwise pro-
vide the State with evidence of a testimoni-
al or communicative nature.” Pennsylva-
nia v. Muniz, 496 U.S. 582, 588-89, 110
S.Ct. 2638, 110 L.Ed.2d 528 (1990) (cita-
tions omitted). The Fifth Amendment
“does not independently proscribe the
compelled production of every sort of in-
criminating evidence but applies only when
the accused is compelled to make a testi-
monial communication that is incrimina-
ting.” Fisher, 425 U.S. at 408, 96 S.Ct.
1569. To be testimonial, a communication
must either “explicitly or implicitly ...
relate a factual assertion or disclose infor-
mation.” Doe v. United States, 487 U.S.
201, 210, 108 S.Ct. 2341, 101 L.Ed.2d 184
(1988).

In Fisher, the High Court explained
that in addition to traditional testimony,
acts of production may implicate the Fifth
Amendment because the “act of producing
evidence in response to a subpoena never-
554 Pa.

theless has communicative aspects of its
own, wholly aside from the contents of the
papers produced.” 425 U.S. at 410, 96 S.Ct.
1569. The Court explained that compliance
with a request for evidence “tacitly con-
cedes” the existence of the evidence, pos-
session or control of the evidence by the
individual, and the belief that the evidence
is, in fact, the item requested by the gov-
ernment. Jd. Whether the act of produc-
tion has a testimonial aspect sufficient to
warrant Fifth Amendment protection “de-
pends on the facts and circumstances of
particular cases or classes thereof.” Id.

It is well established that some com-
pelled acts have no testimonial aspects
and, thus, no Fifth Amendment protection,
as the acts do not require an accused to
relate a factual assertion, disclose knowl-
edge, or “speak his guilt.” Doe v. United
States, 487 U.S. 201, at 210-11, 108 S.Ct.
2341, 101 L.Ed.2d 184 (1988). These in-
clude, for example, furnishing a blood
sample, providing a voice or handwriting
exemplar, or standing in a line-up. Jd. (col-
lecting cases). Other compelled acts, such
as the production of certain subpoenaed
documents, may have a compelled testimo-
nial aspect warranting Fifth Amendment
protection where the government’s de-
mand is akin to a “detailed written inter-
rogatory or a series of questions at a dis-
covery deposition,” characterized as a
“fishing expedition.” United States v. Hub-
bell, 530 U.S. 27, 36, 41-42, 120 S.Ct. 2037,
147 L.Ed.2d 24 (2000).1

1. In Hubbell, the Supreme Court held that the
act of producing thousands of subpoenaed
documents had testimonial aspects in that the
act of production communicated information
about the documents’ existence, custody, and
authenticity. The High Court concluded that,
unlike in Fisher, the government had shown
no prior knowledge of either the existence or
whereabouts of the documents, thus, the fore-
gone conclusion exception to the Fifth

220 ATLANTIC REPORTER, 3d SERIES

Finding that an act of production has
testimonial aspects, however, does not nec-
essarily mean that the Fifth Amendment
privilege precludes compulsion of the evi-
dence sought. As the majority cogently
observes, the United States Supreme
Court has found that information, other-
wise testimonial in nature, is unprotected
where the production of such information
is a foregone conclusion. Majority Opinion
at 548. The foregone conclusion exception
applies where the existence and location of
the compelled evidence “adds little or
nothing to the sum total of the govern-
ment’s information.” Fisher, 425 U.S. at
410, 96 S.Ct. 1569. The High Court in
Fisher explained that a foregone conclu-
sion exists where “[t]he question is not of
testimony but of surrender.” Jd. at 411
(quoting In re Harris, 221 U.S. 274, 279,
31 S.Ct. 557, 55 L.Ed. 732 (1911)). Thus, as
the majority recognizes, “what is otherwise
testimonial in nature is rendered non-testi-
monial, as the facts sought to be compelled
are a foregone conclusion.” Majority Opin-
ion at 548.

In my opinion, the compulsion of Appel-
lant’s password is an act of production,
requiring him to produce a piece of evi-
dence similar to the act of production re-
quiring one to produce a business or finan-
cial document, as occurred in Fisher? See
Trial Court Order, 6/20/2016 (directing Ap-
pellant to “supply the Commonwealth with
any and all passwords used to access the
HP Envy 700 desktop computer with serial
# MXX4100000042C containing Seagate 2

Amendment privilege against self-incrimina-
tion did not apply.

2. The summonses in Fisher directed the de-
fendants’ attorneys to produce documents re-
lating to the defendants’ tax returns in con-
nection with an investigation into possible
civil or criminal liability under federal income
tax laws.

# Z4Z1AAAEFM”). An order compelling
disclosure of the password, here a 64-char-
acter password, has testimonial attributes,
not in the characters themselves, but in
the conveyance of information establishing
that the password exists, that Appellant
has possession and control of the pass-
word, and that the password is authentic,
as it will decrypt the encrypted computer
files. The Commonwealth is not seeking
the 64-character password as an investiga-
tive tool, as occurred in Hubbell, where the
government compelled the disclosure of
thousands of documents to engage in a
fishing expedition to discover evidence of
the defendant’s guilt. To the contrary, the
Commonwealth already possesses evidence
of Appellant’s guilt, which it set forth in an
affidavit of probable cause to obtain a war-
rant to search Appellant’s computer. Stat-
ed differently, the Commonwealth is not
asking Appellant to “speak his guilt,” but
merely to allow the government to execute
a warrant that it lawfully obtained.

Because I view the compulsion order as
requiring the “surrender” of Appellant’s
password to decrypt his computer files, I
would apply Fisher’s act-of-production
test. The majority declines to apply the
foregone conclusion rationale to the com-
pelled disclosure of Appellant’s computer
password, finding that to do so would con-
stitute a “compulsion of one’s mental pro-
cesses” in violation of the Fifth Amend-
ment. Majority Opinion at 549. There is
appeal to this conclusion, as requiring Ap-
pellant to supply his password involves
some mental effort in recalling the 64

3. I recognize that the majority’s conclusion in
this regard finds support in commentary
found in federal cases, suggesting a constitu-
tional distinction between the compelled sur-
render of a key and the compelled disclosure
of a combination to a wall safe. For the rea-
sons set forth herein, however, I do not find
any such distinction dispositive in a case in-
volving current day technology relating to the

characters used to encrypt the computer
files.? However, one would expend similar
mental effort when engaging in virtually
any other act of production, such as the
disclosure of business or financial records,
as the individual must retrieve the con-
tents of his mind to recall the documents’
location before disclosing them to the gov-
ernment. Under the majority’s reasoning,
the compelled production of documents
would be tantamount to placing the defen-
dant on the stand and requiring him to
testify as to the location of the documents
sought. The mere fact that Appellant is
required to think in order to complete the
act of production, in my view, does not
immunize that act of production from the
foregone conclusion rationale.

II. Application of the Foregone
Conclusion Test

Having determined that the foregone
conclusion rationale may potentially apply
to cases involving the compelled disclosure
of a computer password, significant ques-
tions arise regarding how to administer
the three-part test. As observed by the
majority, to satisfy the foregone conclusion
exception to the Fifth Amendment privi-
lege, “the government must establish its
knowledge of: (1) the existence of the evi-
dence demanded; (2) the possession or con-
trol of the evidence by the defendant; and
(8) the authenticity of the evidence.” Ma-
jority Opinion at 549.

As an alternative holding, the majority
opines that if the Court were to find that
the foregone conclusion exception could

compelled disclosure of a password to en-
crypted digital information, where the Com-
monwealth has a warrant to search the digital
container. Only the High Court can make the
final determination in this regard for pur-
poses of the Fifth Amendment, and the pres-
ent case offers an attractive vehicle by which
the Court could do so.
556 Pa,

apply to the compelled disclosure of a
password, it would apply Fisher’s act-of-
production test to the computer files
stored on Appellant’s computer. See Ma-
jority Opinion at 551 n.9 (holding that “be-
cause the Commonwealth has failed to es-
tablish that its search is limited to the
single previously identified file [containing
child pornography], and has not asserted
that it is a foregone conclusion as to the
existence of additional files that may be on
the computer, which would be accessible to
the Commonwealth upon Appellant’s com-
pelled disclosure of the password, we find
the Commonwealth has not satisfied the
foregone conclusion exception”).

Respectfully, it is my position that the
foregone conclusion exception as applied to
the facts presented relates not to the com-
puter files, but to the password itself. Ap-
pellant’s computer files were not the sub-
ject of the compulsion order, which instead
involved only the password that would act
to decrypt those files. This change of focus
is subtle, but its effect is significant. While
the government’s knowledge of the specific
files contained on Appellant’s computer
hard drive would be central to any claim
asserted pursuant to the Fourth Amend-
ment, the same is not dispositive of the
instant claim based upon the Fifth Amend-
ment right against — self-incrimination,
which focuses upon whether the evidence
compelled, here, the password, requires
the defendant to provide incriminating,
testimonial evidence. See Doe v. United
States (In re Grand Jury Subpoena), 383
F.3d 905, 910 (9th Cir. 2004) (providing
that “it is the government’s knowledge of
the existence and possession of the actual
documents [subpoenaed by the govern-
ment], not the information contained
therein, that is central to the foregone
conclusion inquiry”). This Court should not
alleviate concerns over the potential over-
breadth of a digital search in violation of
Fourth Amendment privacy concerns by

220 ATLANTIC REPORTER, 3d SERIES

invoking the Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination, which offers no
privacy protection. The High Court in
Fisher made this point clear by stating,
“We cannot cut the Fifth Amendment
loose from the moorings of its language,
and make it serve as a general protector of
privacy — a word not mentioned in its text
and a concept directly addressed in the

Accordingly, I would align myself with
those jurisdictions that examine the requi-
sites of the foregone conclusion exception
by focusing only on the compelled evidence
itself, i.e., the computer password, and not
the decrypted files that the password
would ultimately reveal. See, e.g., United
States v. Apple MacPro Computer, 851

sound argument can be made that the
foregone conclusion doctrine properly fo-
cuses on whether the Government already
knows the testimony that is implicit in the
act of production. In this case, the fact
known to the government that is implicit
in the act of providing the password for
the device is ‘I, John Doe, know the pass-
word for these devices.’”); State v. John-

gone conclusion exception as applied to the
compelled entering of one’s cell phone pas-

knowledge about the existence of the pas-
scode, his possession and control of the
phone’s passcode, and the passcode’s au-
thenticity); Commonwealth v. Gelfgatt, 11

clusion exception because the government

and control of the computers, knowledge
of the encryption, and knowledge of the
encryption key); State v. Andrews, 197

that whether the government was aware of
the possible contents of the defendant’s

order requires defendant to disclose the
passcodes, not the contents of the phones
unlocked by those passcodes”).

III. Application to Future Cases

Finally, it is my belief that the majori-
ty’s approach could render inconsistent re-
sults as the determination of whether
there was a Fifth Amendment violation in
compelled decryption cases could depend
upon the type of password that the indi-
vidual employed to protect his encrypted
files. For example, according to the major-
ity, if the accused used a multi-character
password to encrypt computer files, as oc-
curred here, and the government com-
pelled the individual to supply the pass-
word, a Fifth Amendment violation would
result because the password manifests
through the use of one’s mind. Majority
Opinion at 550. However, if the individual
employed a biometric password, such as
facial recognition or a fingerprint, the ma-
jority’s analysis would arguably lose its
force. Under those circumstances, the in-
dividual is not using the contents of his
mind but, rather, is performing a com-
pelled act of placing his finger or face in
the appropriate position to decrypt the
files. Additional questions arise when the
act of compulsion is not the disclosure of
the password itself, but the entry of the
password into the computer. It is my posi-
tion that all these examples constitute acts
of production that would be subject to the
foregone conclusion rationale in the appro-
priate case. The same legal analysis
should apply to the underlying act of com-

pelled decryption of digital information
when the government has obtained a war-
rant to search the digital container. To
hold to the contrary would create an en-
tire class of evidence, encrypted computer
files, that is impervious to governmental
search. This could potentially alter the
balance of power between governmental
authorities and criminals, and render law
enforcement incapable of accessing rele-
vant evidence.

IV. Conclusion

Accordingly, I would hold that the fore-
gone conclusion exception to the Fifth
Amendment privilege against self-incrimi-
nation applies to render non-testimonial
Appellant’s compelled act of producing the
password to his encrypted, lawfully seized
computer. As the majority observes, when
government agents attempted to execute
the search warrant, Appellant voluntarily
informed them that he was the sole user of
the computer, that he used hardwired In-
ternet services that were password pro-
tected, that only he knew the password to
decrypt his computer files, and that he
would never disclose the password, as it
would incriminate him.

In addition to Appellant’s voluntary dis-
closure to government agents that he knew
the password that would decrypt the files
stored on the computer that the Common-
wealth lawfully seized, there is ample cir-
cumstantial evidence demonstrating Appel-
lant’s knowledge of the password. Before
seizing the computer, government agents
conducted an investigation of the “eMule”
peer-to-peer network to identify internet
users sharing child pornography. Agents
made a direct connection with a device
that used a particular IP address over the
eMule network, which agents subsequently
linked to Appellant. Using this direct con-
nection, agents downloaded one child por-
nography video file from Appellant’s IP

address. Affidavit of Probable Cause,
10/20/2015, at 7. Based on this download,
the agents obtained the search warrant for
Appellant’s residence. Id. at 9.

Upon executing the search warrant,
agents seized a single desktop computer,
as that was the only device connected to
Appellant’s IP address. N.T., 1/14/2016, at
33. Forensic analysis revealed that Appel-
lant’s IP address had used the eMule file-
sharing program on 23 dates from July 4,
2015, through October 19, 2015, to share
files indicative of child pornography. Affi-
davit of Probable Cause, 10/20/2015, at 10-
11; N.T., 1/14/2016, at 29. Agent Daniel
Block explained that the government
reached this conclusion based upon the
“SHA value,” which is essentially a “digital
fingerprint” that corresponds with known
SHA values of child pornography files.
N.T., 1/14/2016, at 20. This evidence dem-
onstrates that Appellant possessed the
password to decrypt files on the computer
seized by the Commonwealth, as his own
words established that he was the sole
user of the computer and forensic analysis
demonstrated that he was accessing the
encrypted files on the days leading up to
his arrest.

Under these circumstances, it was a
foregone conclusion that the government
knew that the password to decrypt the
files existed, that Appellant had exclusive
control over the password, and that the
password was authentic.’ Accordingly, the
testimonial aspects of the password disclo-
sure “adds little or nothing to the sum
total of the government’s information.”

4. I would hold that the authenticity prong of
the foregone conclusion exception requires
the government to establish that the com-
pelled information is what it purports to be,
i.e., a password that will decrypt the comput-
er files on Appellant’s hard drive. The Com-
monwealth may prove the authenticity of the
password by Appellant’s own voluntary state-
ments. See Pa.R.E. 901(b) (providing that the

Fisher, 425 U.S. at 410, 96 S.Ct. 1569.
Thus, I would find that the compelled dis-
closure of Appellant’s password does not
violate his Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination.

JURY

Petition of: R.M.L.
No. 85 WM 2018
Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.

Submitted: December 14, 2018
Decided: November 20, 2019

Background: Roman Catholic priest filed
motion with investigating grand jury’s su-
pervising judge for redaction of specific
portions of public report detailing grand
jury’s summary of communications be-
tween priest and mental health profession-
als in response to complaint of sexual
abuse. The supervising judge permitted
disclosure. Priest filed petition for review.

Holdings: The Supreme Court, No. 85
WM 2018, Todd, J., held that:

requirement of authenticating an item of evi-
dence may be satisfied by testimony of a wit-
ness with knowledge that an item is what it is
claimed to be). Here, Appellant’s voluntary
statements establish that the password would
decrypt the files on his hard drive; thus, I
would conclude that the authenticity require-
ment has been satisfied.
