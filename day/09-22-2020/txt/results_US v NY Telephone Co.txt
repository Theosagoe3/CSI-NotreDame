UNITED STATES v. NEW YORK TELEPHONE CO.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT

No. 76-885. Argued October 3, 1977—Decided December 7, 1977

On the basis of an FBI affidavit stating that certam mdividuals were
conducting an illegal gambling enterprise at a specified New York City
address and that there was probable cause to believe that two telephones
with different numbers were bemg used there to further the illegal
activity, the Distinct Court authorized the FBI to imstall and use pen
registers with respect to the two telephones, and directed respondent
telephone company to furmsh the FBI “all formation, facilities and
technical assistance” necessary to employ the devices, which (without
overhearing oral communications or indicating whether calls are com-
pleted) record the numbers dialed. The FBI was ordered to compensate
respondent at prevailing rates. Respondent, though providing certam
information, refused to lease to the FBI lines that were needed for
unobirusive mstallation of the pen registers, and thereafter filed a
motion in the Distnet Court to vacate that portion of the pen register
order directing respondent to furnish facilities and technical assistance
to the FBI, on the ground that such a directive could be issued only in
connection with a wiretap order meeting the requirements of Title III of
the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. The District
Court ruled adversely to respondent, holding that pen registers are not
governed by Title III, that the court had jumsdiction to authonze
installation of the devices upon a showing of probable cause; and that
it had authority to direct respondent to assist m the mstallation both
under the court’s herent powers and under the All Writs Act, which
gives federal courts authority to issue “all writs necessary or appropnate
in aid of their respective junsdictions and agreeable to the usages and
principles of law” Though agreemg with the District Court's Title TIT
rationale, and concluding that district courts have power either mherently
or as a logical derivative of Fed. Rule Crm. Proc. 41, to authorize pen:
register surveillance upon a probable-cause showmg, the Court of
Appeals, affirmmg im part and reversing in part, held that the District
Court abused its discretion in ordering respondent to assist m mstalling
and operating the pen registers, and expressed concern that such a
requirement could establish an undesirable precedent for the authority
of federal courts to mpress unwilling aid on private third parties. Held.

Syllabus 4340.8.

1. Title III, which 1s concerned only with orders “authorizing or
approving the méerception of a wire or oral communication,” does not
govern the authorization of the use of pen registers, which do not
‘4ntercept” because they do not acquire the “contents” of communica-
tions as those terms are defined m the statute. Moreover, the legislative
instory of Title III shows that the definition of “intercept” was designed
to exclude pen registers. Pp. 165-168.

2. The District Court under Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 41 had power to
authorize the installation of the pen registers, that Rule bemg sufficiently
flexible to melude within its scope electronic intrusions authorized upon
a finding of probable cause. Pp. 168-170.

3. The order compelling respondent to provide assistance was clearly
authorized by the All Writs Act and comported with the intent of
Congress. Pp. 171-178.

(a) The power conferred by the Act extends, under appropriate
circumstances, to persons who (though not parties to the origmal action
or engaged mn wrongdoing) are in a position to frustrate the umplemen-
tation of a court order or the proper admimustration of justice. Here
respondent, which is a lnghly regulated public utility with a duty to
serve the public, was not so far removed as a third party from the
underlying controversy that its assistance could not permussibly be com-
pelled by the order of the court based on a probable-cause showing
that respondent’s facilities were beimg illegally used on a continumg
basis. Moreover, respondent concededly uses the devices for its billing
operations, detecting fraud, and preventing law violations. And, as the
Court of Appeals recognized, provision of a leased line by respondent
was essential to fulfillment of the purpose for which the pen register
order had been issued. Pp. 171-175.

(b) The District Court’s order was consistent with a 1970 amend-
ment to Title III providing that “[aJn order authorizing the mtercep-
tion of a wire or oral communication shall, upon request of the appli-
cant, direct that a communication common carner furnish the
applicant forthwith all mformation, facilities, and technical assistance
necessary to accomplish the miterception unobtrusively * Pp.

This case presents the question of whether a United States
District Court may properly direct a telephone company to
provide federal law enforcement officials the facilities and
technical assistance necessary for the 1mplementation of its
order authorizing the use of pen registers? to mvestigate
offenses which there was probable cause to believe were bemg
committed by means of the telephone.

I

On March 19, 1976, the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York issued an order authoriz-
mg agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to
install and use pen registers with respect to two telephones
and directmg the New York Telephone Co. (Company) to
furnish the FBI “all formation, facilities and technical
assistance” necessary to employ the pen registers unobtru-
sively The FBI was ordered to compensate the Company
at prevailing rates for any assistance which 1t furnished. App.
6-7 The order was issued on the basis of an affidavit sub-

a telephone by monitormg the electrical impulses caused when the dial on
the telephone 1s released. It does not overhear oral communications and
does not indicate whether calls are actually completed.
162 OCTOBER TERM, 1977
Opinion of the Court 434U.8,

mitted by an FBI agent which stated that certam mdividuals
were conducting an illegal gambling enterprise at 220 East
14th Street i New York City and that, on the basis of facts
set forth therem, there was probable cause to believe that
two telephones bearmg different numbers were bemg used at
that address mm furtherance of the illegal activity Jd., at
1-5. The District Court found that there was probable cause
to conclude that an illegal gambling enterprise usmg the
facilities of mterstate commerce was being conducted at the
East 14th Street address m violation of 18 U 8. C. §§ 371 and
1952, and that the two telephones had been, were currently
bemg, and would contmue to be used m connection with
those offenses. Its order authorized the FBI to operate the
pen registers with respect to the two telephones until know!l-
edge of the numbers dialed led to the identity of the associates
and confederates of those believed to be conducting the illegal
operation or for 20 days, “whichever is earlier.”

The Company declined to comply fully with the court
order. It did mform the FBI of the location of the relevant
“appearances,” that is, the places where specific telephone
lines emerge from the sealed telephone cable. In addition,
the Company agreed to identify the relevant “pairs,” or the
specific pairs of wires that constituted the circuits of the two
telephone lines. This mformation is required to mstall a
pen register. The Company, however, refused to lease lines
to the FBI which were needed to install the pen registers m
an unobtrusive fashion. Such lines were required by the
FBI m order to mstall the pen registers im mconspicuous
locations away from the building contammg the telephones.
A “leased line” 1s an unused telephone line which makes an
“appearance” in the same terminal box as the telephone line
m connection with which 1t is desired to mstall a pen register.
If the leased line 1s connected to the subject telephone line,
the pen register can then be mstalled on the leased line at a
remote location and be monitored from that pomt. The
UNITED STATES » NEW YORK TELEPHONE CoO. 163
159 Opmion of the Court

Company, instead of providing the leased lines, which it
conceded that the court’s order required 1t to do, advised the
FBI to strmg cables from the “subject apartment” to another
location where pen registers could be installed. The FBI
determmed after canvassing the neighborhood of the apart-
ment for four days that there was no location where 1t could
string its own wires and attach the pen registers without
alerting the suspects,’ in which event, of course, the gambling
operation would cease to function. App. 15-22.

On March 30, 1976, the Company moved m the District
Court to vacate that portion of the pen register order directing
it to furnish facilities and technical assistance to the FBI in
connection with the use of the pen registers on the ground
that such a directive could be issued only m connection with
a wiretap order conforming to the requirements of Title III
of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968,
18 U S. C. §§ 2510-2520 (1970 ed. and Supp. V)_ It con-
tended that neither Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 41 nor the All
Writs Act, 28 U 8. C. § 1651 (a), provided any basis for such
an order. App. 10-14. The District Court ruled that pen
registers are not governed by the proseriptions of Title III
because they are not devices used to intercept oral communi-
cations. It concluded that 1t had jurisdiction to authorize
the installation of the pen registers upon a showing of prob-
able cause and that both the All Writs Act and its mherent
powers provided authority for the order directing the Com-
pany to assist in the installation of the pen registers.

On April 9, 1976, after the District Court and the Court
of Appeals denied the Company’s motion to stay the pen
register order pending appeal, the Company provided the
leased lines.?

2The gambling operation was known to employ countersurveillance
techniques. App. 21.

the origimal order of March 19 for an additional 20 days. Id., at 38.
164 OCTOBER TERM, 1977
Opiion of the Court 434 U8.

The Court of Appeals affirmed m part and reversed mm part,
with one judge dissenting on the ground that the order below
should have been affirmed m its entirety Applicaton of
United States re Pen Register Order, 588 F 2d 956 (CA2
1976) It agreed with the District Court that pen registers do
not fall withm the scope of Title III and are not otherwise
prohibited or regulated by statute. The Court of Appeals
also concluded that district courts have the power, either
inherently or as a logical derivative of Fed. Crim. Proce. 41,
to authorize pen register surveillance upon an adequate show-
ing of probable cause. The majority held, however, that
the District Court abused its discretion m ordermg the Com-
pany to assist m the installation and operation of the pen
registers. It assumed, arguendo, that “a district court has
inherent discretionary authority or discretionary power under
the All Writs Act to compel technical assistance by the Tele-
phone Company,” but concluded that “in the absence of
specific and properly limited Congressional action, 1+ was an
abuse of discretion for the District Court to order the Tele-
phone Company to furmsh technical assistance.” 588 F 2d,
at 961* The majority expressed concern that “such an order
could establish a most undesirable, if not dangerous and
unwise, precedent for the authority of federal courts to impress
unwilling aid on private third parties” and that “there is no
assurance that the court will always be able to protect [third
parties] from excessive or overzealous Government activity or
compulsion.” Id., at 962-963.°

*The Court of Appeals recognized that “without [the Company’s] tech-
nical aid, the order authonzing the use of a pen register will be worthless.
Federal law enforcement agents simply cannot mmplement pen register
surveillance without the Telephone Company’s help. The assistance re-
quested requires no extraordinary expenditure of time or effort by [the
Company], mdeed, as we understand it, providing lease or private lines
is a relatively simple, routine procedure.” 538 F 2d, at 961-962.

* possessed a discretionary power under the All Writs Act to direct the

We granted the United States’ petition for certiorari chal-
lengmg the Court of Appeals’ imvalidation of the District
Court’s order against respondent.? 429U S. 1072.

va

We first reject respondent’s contention, which 1s renewed
here, that the District Court lacked authority to order the
Company to provide assistance because the use of pen regis-
ters may be authorized only m conformity with the procedures
set forth in Title III ~ for securing Judicial authority to mter-

Company to render such assistance as was necessary to umplement its valid
order authorizmg the use of pen registers and that a compelling case had
been established for the exercise of discretion in favor of the assistance
order. He argued that district court judges could be trusted to exercise
their powers under the All Writs Act only m cases of clear necessity and
to balance the burden imposed upon the party required to render assistance
against the necessity

5 Although the pen register surveillance had been completed by the time
the Court of Appeals issued its decision on July 13, 1976, this fact does not
render the case moot, because the controversy here is one “capable of
Tepetition, yet evading review” Southern Pacific Terminal Co. y ICC,
219 U.S. 498, 515 (1911), Roe v Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 125 (1973). Pen
register orders issued pursuant to Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 41 authonze
surveillance only for brief periods. Here, despite expedited action by the
Court of Appeals, the order, as extended, expired six days after oral
argument. Moreover, even had the pen register order been stayed pending
appeal, the mootness problem would have remaimed, because the showing
of probable cause upon which the order authonzmg the mstallation of the
pen registers was based would almost certamly have become stale before
Teview could have been completed. It 1s also plam, given the Company’s
policy of refusmg to render voluntary assistance in mstalling pen registers
and the Government’s determmation to continue to utilize them, that the
Company will be subjected to sumilar orders in the future. See Westen
v Bradford, 423 U.S. 147, 149 (1975)

7 The Court of Appeals held that pen register surveillance was subject to
the requirements of the Fourth Amendment. This conclusion 1s not chal-
lenged by either party, and we find it unnecessary to consider the matter.
The Government concedes that its application for the pen register order did
not conform to the requirements of Title ITI.

cept wire communications.® Both the language of the statute
and its legislative history establish beyond any doubt that
pen registers are not governed by Title III.® °

Title III 1s concerned only with orders “authorizmg or
approving the mterceptron of a wire or oral communica-
tion » 18 U S. C. §2518 (1) (emphasis added).*°
Congress defined “intercept” to mean “the aural acquisition of
the contents of any wire or oral communication through the
use of any electronic, mechanical, or other device.” 18U S.C.

8 Although neither this issue nor that of the scope of Fed. Rule Crim.
Proc. 41 1s encompassed within the question posed m the petition for
certiorari and the Company has not filed a cross-petition, we have discretion
to consider them because the prevailing party may defend a judgment on
any ground which the law and the record permit that would not expand the
relief it has been granted. Langnes v Green, 282 U S. 581, 588-539
(1931), Dandridge v Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 475 n. 6 (1970) The only
relief sought by the Company 1s that granted by the Court of Appeals: the
reversal of the District Court’s order directing it to assist in the installation
and operation of the pen registers. The Title III and Rule 41 questions
were considered by both the District Court and the Court of Appeals and
fully argued here.

®Four Justices reached this conclusion in United States v Giordano,
416 U.S. 505, 553-554 (1974) (Powe, J., jomed by Buresr, C. J., and
Bruackuun and ReHNQuIsT, JJ., concurrmg m part and dissenting in
part). The Court’s opmion did not reach the issue since the evidence
derived from a pen register was suppressed as bemg m turn derived from
an illegal wire interception. Every Court of Appeals that has considered
the matter has agreed that pen registers are not with the scope of
Title III. See United States v Illinois Bell Tel. Co., 581 F 2d 809 (CA7
1976), United States v Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 546 F 2d 243 (CAS
1976), Michigan Bell Tel. Co. v United States, 565 F 2d 385 (CA6
1977), United States v Falcone, 505 F 2d 478 (CA8 1974), cert. denied,
420 U 8. 955 (1975), Hodge v Mountan States Tel. & Tel. Co., 555 F
2d 254 (CAQ 1977), United States v. Clegg, 509 F 2d 605, 610 n. 6 (CA5
1975).

10Similarly, the sanctions of Title III are aimed only at one who
“willfully mtereepts, endeavors to mtercept, or procures any other person
to intercept or endeavor to mtercept, any wire or oral communica-
tion ” 180.8. C. § 2511 (1) (a)
UNITED STATES v. NEW YORK TELEPHONE CO. 167
159 Opmion of the Court

§ 2510 (4) (emphasis added) Pen registers do not “intercept”
because they do not acquire the “contents” of communications,
as that term is defined by 18 U S.C. § 2510 (8) ™ Indeed, a
law enforcement official could not even determme from the use
of a pen register whether a communication existed. These
devices do not hear sound. They disclose only the telephone
numbers that have been dialed—a means of establishing com-
munication. Neither the purport of any communication
between the caller and the recipient of the call, their identities,
nor whether the call was even completed is disclosed by pen
registers. Furthermore, pen registers do not accomplish the
“aural acquisition” of anythmg. They decode outgoing tele-
phone numbers by responding to changes m electrical voltage
caused by the turning of the telephone dial (or the pressing of
buttons on pushbutton telephones) and present the mfor-
mation in a form to be interpreted by sight rather than by
hearing.”

The legislative history confirms that there was no con-
gressional intent to subject pen registers to the requirements
of Title III. The Senate Report explained that the definition
of “intercept” was designed to exclude pen registers:

“Paragraph 4 [of § 2510] defines ‘intercept’ to melude
the aural acquisition of the contents of any wire or oral
communication by any electronic, mechanical, or other
device. Other forms of surveillance are not within the
proposed legislation. The proposed legislation 1s not
designed to preventthe tracing of phone calls. The
use of a ‘pen register,’ for example, would be permissible.
But see United States v Dote, 371 F 2d 176 (7th 1966)
The proposed legislation 1s mtended to protect the
privacy of the communication itself and not the means of

21“ ‘Contents’ includes any information concerning the identity of
the parties to [the] communication or the existence, substance, purport, or
meaning of [the] communication.”

communication.” §. Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess.,
90 (1968) **

It 1s clear that Congress did not view pen registers as posing
a threat to privacy of the same dimension as the mterception
of oral communications and did not intend to impose Title ITI
restrictions upon their use.

TIT

We also agree with the Court of Appeals that the District
Court had power to authorize the mstallation of the pen reg-
isters.* It 1s undisputed that the order in this case was
predicated upon a proper finding of probable cause, and no
clarm is made that 1t was m any way inconsistent with the

18 United States v. Dote, 371 F 2d 176 (CA7 1966), held that § 605 of
the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U 8S. C. § 605, which prohibited the
interception and divulgence of “any communication” by wire or radio,
meluded pen registers withm the scope of its ban. In § 803 of Title III,
82 Stat. 223, Congress amended § 605 by restricting it to the interception
of “any radio communication.” Thus it 1s clear that pen registers are no
longer within the scope of § 605. See Korman v. United States, 486 F 2d
926, 931-932 (CA7 1973) The reference to Dote m the Senate Report is
indicative of Congress’ mtention not to place restrictions upon their use.
We find no merit m the Company’s suggestion that the reference to Dote
is merely an oblique expression of Congress’ desire that telephone com-
panies be permitted to use pen registers m the ordinary course of business,
as Dote allowed, so long as they are not used to assist law enforcement.
Bnef for Respondent 16. The sentences preceding the reference to Dote
state unequivocally that pen registers are not withm the scope of Title TIT.
In addition, a separate provision of Title ITI, 18 U 8. C. § 2511 (2) (a) (i),
specifically excludes all normal telephone company busmess practices from
the prohibitions of the Act. Congress clearly mtended to disavow Dote
to the extent that it prohibited the use of pen registers by law enforcement
authorities.

14 The Courts of Appeals that have considered the question have agreed
that pen register orders are authored by Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 41 or by
an inherent power closely akin to it to issue search warrants under
circumstances conforming to the Fourth Amendment. See Michigan Bell
Tel. Co., supra, Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., supra, Ilinow Bell Tel. Co.,
supra.
UNITED STATES v. NEW YORK TELEPHONE CO. 169
159 Opmion of the Court

Fourth Amendment. Federal Rule Crim. Proc. 41 (b) author-
izes the issuance of a warrant to

“search for and seize any (1) property that constitutes
evidence of the commission of a ermminal offense, or
(2) contraband, the fruits of crime, or thimgs otherwise
crmminally possessed, or (3) property designed or mtended
for use or which 1s or has been used as the means of com-
mutting a crimmal offense.”

This authorization 1s broad enough to encompass a “search”
designed to ascertam the use which 1s bemg made of a tele-
phone suspected of being employed as a means of facilitatmg
a criminal venture and the “seizure” of evidence which the
“search” of the telephone produces. Although Rule 41 (h)
defines property “to melude documents, books, papers and
any other tangible objects,” 1t does not restrict or purport to
exhaustively enumerate all the items which may be seized
pursuant to Rule 41.%° Indeed, we recogmzed m Katz v
United States, 389 U S. 347 (1967), which held that telephone
conversations were protected by the Fourth Amendment, that
Rule 41 1s not limited to tangible items but 1s sufficiently
flexible to include within its scope electronic mtrusions author-
wed upon a finding of probable cause. 389 U §S., at 354-356,
and n. 16.7% See also Osborn v United States, 385 U S. 323,
329-331 (1966)

15 Where the definition of a term m Rule 41 (h) was tended to be all
inclusive, it 1s introduced by the phrase “to mean” rather than “to mnclude.”
Cf. Helvering v Morgan’s, Inc., 293 U §. 121, 125 n. 1 (1934)

146The question of whether the FBI, m its mmplementation of the
District Court’s pen register authorization, complied with all the require-
ments of Rule 41 1s not before us. In Katz, the Court stated that the
notice requirement of Rule 41 (d) 1s not so inflexible as to require nvaniably
that notice be given the person “searched” prior to the commencement of
the search. 389 U. S., at 355-356, n. 16. Similarly, it 1s clear to us that
the requirement of Rule 41 (c) that the warrant command that the
search be conducted with 10 days of its issuance does not mean that
the duration of a pen register surveillance may not exceed 10 days. Thus
170 OCTOBER TERM, 1977
Opimon of the Court 434U.8.

Our conclusion that Rule 41 authorizes the use of pen
registers under appropriate circumstances 1s supported by
Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 57 (b), which provides: “If no proce-
dure 1s specifically prescribed by rule, the court may proceed
m any lawful manner not meonsistent with these rules or
with any applicable statute.”?” Although we need not and
do not decide whether Rule 57 (b) by itself would authorize
the issuance of pen register orders, 1¢ remforces our conclusion
that Rule 41 1s sufficiently broad to clude seizures of ntangi-
ble 1tems such as dial impulses recorded by pen registers as
well as tangible items.

Finally, we could not hold that the District Court lacked
any power to authorize the use of pen registers without defy-
ing the congressional judgment that the use of pen registers
“be permissible.” §. Rep. No. 1097, supra, at 90. Indeed, it
would be anomalous to permit the recording of conversations
by means of electronic surveillance while prohibitimg the far
lesser mtrusion accomplished by pen registers. Congress
intended no such result. We are unwilling to mpose 1t in the
absence of some showmg that the issuance of such orders
would be inconsistent with Rule 41. Cf. Rule 57 (b), supra.”

the District Court’s order, which authorized surveillance for a 20-day
period, did not conflict with Rule 41.

17See United States v Bard, 414 F 2d 700, 710 (CA2 1969), cert.
demed, 396 U. S. 1005 (1970), Jackson v United States, 122 U S. App.
D. C. 324, 326, 353 F 2d 862, 864 (1965), United States v Remolif, 227 F

633 n. 8 (1962) (applymg the analogous provision of Fed. Rule Civ
Proe. 83)

18 The dissent argues, post, at 182-184, that Rule 41 (b), as modified
followmg Warden v Hayden, 387 U. S, 294 (1967), to explicitly authorize
searches for any property that constitutes evidence of a crime, falls short of
authorizing warrants to “search” for and “seize” mtangible evidence. The
elimmation of the restriction agamst seizmg property that is “mere
evidence,” however, has no bearmg whatsoever on the scope of the defin-
tion of property set forth m Rule 41 (h) which, as the dissent acknowledges,
remamed unchanged. Moreover, the definition of property set forth m

159 Opmmion of the Court

Iv

The Court of Appeals held that even though the District
Court had ample authority to issue the pen register warrant
and even assuming the applicability of the All Writs Act,
the order compelling the Company to provide technical assist-
ance constituted an abuse of discretion. Since the Court
of Appeals conceded that a compelling case existed for requir-
mg the assistance of the Company and did not pomt to any
fact particular to this case which would warrant a finding of
abuse of discretion, we mterpret its holding as generally
barring district courts from ordermg any party to assist in
the installation or operation of a pen register. It was appar-
ently concerned that sustamimg the District Court’s order
would authorize courts to compel third parties to render assist-
ance without limitation regardless of the burden mvolved and
pose a severe threat to the autonomy of third parties who for

Rule 41 (h) 1s mtroduced by the phrase, “[t]he term ‘property’ 1s used in
this rule to include” (emphasis added), which indicates that it was not
intended to be exhaustive. See supra, at 169.

We are unable to comprehend the logic supporting the dissent’s conten-
tion, post, at 184-185, that the conclusion of Katz v United States that
Rule 41 was not confined to tangible property did not survive the enact-
ment of Title IIT and Title IX of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe
Streets Act of 1968, because Congress failed to expand the definition of
property contained in Rule 41 (h). There was obviously no need for any
such action m light of the Court’s construction of the Rule m Katz. The
dissent’s assertion that it “strams credulity” to conclude that Congress
intended to permit the seizure of intangibles outside the scope of Title IIT
without its safeguards disregards the congressional yudgment that the use of
pen registers be permussible without Title III restrictions. Indeed, the
dissent concedes that pen registers are not governed by Title IIT. What
“strains credulity” 1s the dissent’s conclusion, directly contradicted by the
legislative nstory of Title III, that Congress mtended to permit the mnter-
ception of telephone conversations while prohibiting the use of pen registers
to obtam much more limited information.

duties upon third parties is not without limits, unreasonable
burdens may not be imposed. We conclude, however, that
the order issued here against respondent was clearly author-
ized by the All Writs Act and was consistent with the intent
of Congress.?®
The All Writs Act provides:

“The Supreme Court and all courts established by Act
of Congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate
m aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to
the usages and prmeiples of law” 28U S.C. § 1651 (a)

The assistance of the Company was required here to umple-
ment a pen register order which we have held the District
Court was empowered to issue by Rule 41. This Court has
repeatedly recognized the power of a federal court to issue
such commands under the All Writs Act as may be necessary
or appropriate to effectuate and prevent the frustration of
orders 1t has previously issued m its exereise of jurisdiction

Seventh Circuit m United States v Illinns Bell Tel. Co., 581 F 2d 809
(1976), held that the Act did authorize the issuance of orders compel-
ling a telephone company to assist m the use of surveillance devices not
covered by Title III such as pen registers. The Eighth Circuit found such
authority to be part of the mherent power of distnict courts and “con-
comitant of the power to authorize pen register surveillance.” United

UNITED STATES v. NEW YORK TELEPHONE CO. 173
159 Opinion of the Court

Congress, a, federal court may avail itself of all auxiliary writs
as aids mm the performance of 1ts duties, when the use of such
historic aids 1s calculated m its sound judgment to achieve
the ends of justice entrusted to it.” Adams v United States
ex rel. McCann, 317 US. 269, 273 (1942)

The Court has consistently applied the Act flexibly m con-
formity with these principles. Although § 262 of the Judicial
Code, the predecessor to § 1651, did not expressly authorize
courts, as does $1651, to issue writs “appropriate” to the
proper exercise of their jurisdiction but only “necessary” writs,
Adams held that these supplemental powers are not limited
to those situations where it 1s “necessary” to issue the writ
or order “in the sense that the court could not otherwise
physically discharge its appellate duties.” 317 U S., at 273.
In Pree v Johnston, supra, § 262 supplied the authority for a
United States Court of Appeals to issue an order commanding
that a prisoner be brought before the court for the purpose of
argumng his own appeal. Similarly, m order to avoid frus-
trating the “very purpose’ of 28 U §. C. § 2255, § 1651
furnished the District Court with authority to order that a
federal prisoner be produced m court for purposes of a hearing.
United States v Hayman, 342 U S. 205, 220-222 (1952) The
question m Harris v Nelson, supra, was whether, despite the
absence of specific statutory authority, the District Court could
issue a discovery order in connection with a habeas corpus
proceeding pending before 1t. Eight Justices agreed that the
district courts have power to require discovery when. essential
to render a habeas corpus proceeding effective. The Court has
also held that despite the absence of express statutory author-
ity to do so, the Federal Trade Commission may petition for,
and a Court of Appeals may issue, pursuant to $1651, an
order preventing a merger pending hearmgs before the Com-
mission to avoid impairmg or frustrating the Court of Appeals’
appellate jurisdiction. FTC v Dean Foods Co., 384 U 8. 597

Turning to the facts of this case, we do not think that the
Company was a third party so far removed from the under-
lying controversy that 1ts assistance could not be permissibly
compelled. A United States District Court found that there
was probable cause to believe that the Company’s facilities were
being employed to facilitate a criminal enterprise on a continu-
ing basis. For the Company, with this knowledge, to refuse to
supply the meager assistance required by the FBI m its efforts
to put an end to this venture threatened obstruction of an
investigation which would determine whether the Company’s
facilities were bemg lawfully used. Moreover, 1t can hardly be
contended that the Company, a highly regulated public utility
with a duty to serve the public,” had a substantial interest mn
not providing assistance. Certamly the use of pen registers
is by no means offensive to 1t. The Company concedes that
it regularly employs such devices without court order for the
purposes of checkmmg billing operations, detecting fraud, and

preventing violations of law*® It also agreed to supply the
FBI with all the mformation required to mstall its own pen
registers. Nor was the District Court’s order m any way
burdensome. The order provided that the Company be fully
reimbursed at prevailing rates, and compliance with 1t required
minimal effort on the part of the Company and no disruption
to its operations.

Finally, we note, as the Court of Appeals recognized, that
without the Company’s assistance there 1s no conceivable way
im which the surveillance authorized by the District Court
could have been successfully accomplished.” The FBI, after
an exhaustive search, was unable to find a location where it
could install its own pen registers without tipping off the
targets of the vestigation. The provision of a leased line by
the Company was essential to the fulfillment of the purpose—
to learn the identities of those connected with the gambling
operation—for which the pen register order had been issued.”

22 Tr, of Oral Arg. 27-28, 40.

23 The dissent’s attempt to draw a distinction between orders m aid of a
court’s own duties and jurisdiction and orders designed to better enable a
party to effectuate his rights and duties, post, at 189-190, 1s specious.
Courts normally exercise their jurisdiction only in order to protect the
legal nghts of parties. In Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266 (1948), for
example, the production of the federal prisoner m court was required mn
order to enable him to effectively present his appeal which the court had
junsdiction to hear. Similarly, in Harris v. Nelson, 394 U.S. 286 (1969),
discovery was ordered m connection with a habeas corpus proceeding for
the purpose of enabling a prisoner adequately to protect hs mghts. Here,
we have held that Fed. Rule Crim. Proce. 41 provided the Distnet Court
with power to authorize the FBI to mstall pen registers. The order issued
by the District Court compelling the Company to provide technical assist-
ance was required to prevent nullification of the court’s warrant and the
frustration of the Government’s right under the warrant to conduct a pen
register surveillance, yust as the orders issued m Price and Harns were
necessary to protect the nghts of prisoners.

24We are unable to agree with the Company’s assertion that “it 1s
extraordinary to expect citizens to directly mvolve themselves in the law
176 OCTOBER TERM, 1977
Opinion of the Court 434U.8.

The order compelling the Company to provide assistance
was not only consistent with the Act but also with more recent
congressional actions. As established m Part IT, supra, Con-
gress clearly mtended to permit the use of pen registers by
federal law enforcement officials. Without the assistance of
the Company im circumstances such as those presented here,
however, these devices simply cannot be effectively employed.
Moreover, Congress provided m a 1970 amendment to Title
IIL that “[a]n order authorizing the interception of a wire or
oral communication shall, upon request of the applicant, direct
that a communication common carrier shall furnish the
applicant forthwith all mformation, facilities, and technical
assistance necessary to accomplish the mterception unobtru-
sively ” 18 U S.C. § 2518 (4) In light of this direct

enforcement process.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 41. The conviction that private
citizens have a duty to provide assistance to law enforcement officials when
it 18 required 1s by no means foreign to our traditions, as the Company
apparently believes. See Babington v Yellow Tax Corp., 250 N. Y. 14,
17, 164 N. E. 726, 727 (1928) (Cardozo, C. J.) (“Still, as m the days of
Edward I, the citizenry may be called upon to enforce the justice of the
state, not famtly and with lagging steps, but honestly and bravely and
with whatever implements and facilities are convenient and at hand”)
See also In re Quarles and Butler, 158 U S. 582, 535 (1895) (“It 1s the
duty of every citizen, to assist m prosecuting, and m securmg the
punishment of, any breach of the peace of the United States”), Hamil-
ton v Regents, 293 U S. 245, 265 n. (1934) (Cardozo, J., concurring),
Elrod v Moss, 278 F 123, 129 (CA4 1921) The concept that citizens
have a duty to assist in enforcement of the laws 1s at least m part the
predicate of Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 17, which clearly contemplates power
mm the district courts to issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum to
nonparty witnesses and to hold noncomplying, nonparty witnesses m con-
tempt. Cf. Rovaro v United States, 353 U 8. 53, 59 (1957) (“The
[informer’s] privilege recognizes the obligation of citizens to communi-
cate their knowledge of the commission. of crimes to law-enforcement offi-
cials and, by preserving their anonymity, encourages them to perform that
obligation”). Of course we do not address the question of whether and
to what extent such a general duty may be legally enforced m the diverse
contexts in which it may arise.

power of the federal courts to exercise, where required, a
discretionary authority to order telephone companies to assist

plish a far lesser invasion of privacy > We are convinced that

25 We reject the Court of Appeals’ suggestion that the fact that Congress
amended Title III to require that communication common carriers provide
necessary assistance m connection with electronic surveillance withm the
scope of Title III reveals a congressional “doubt that the courts possessed
mherent power to issue such orders” and therefore “it seems reasonable to
conclude that similar authomzation should be required m connection with
pen register orders ” 588 F 2d, at 962. The amendment was passed
followmg the decision of the Ninth Circuit m Application of United
States, 427 F 2d 689 (1970), which held that absent specific statutory
authority, a United States District Court was without power to compel a
telephone company to assist m a wiretap conducted pursuant to Title IIT.
The court refused to mfer such authority m light of Congress’ silence m a
statute which constituted a “comprehensive legislative treatment” of wire-
tapping. Id., at 643. We think that Congress’ prompt action m amend-
ing the Act was not an acceptance of the Ninth Circuit’s view but “more
im the nature of an overruling of that opmion.” United States v Illinows
Bell Tel. Co., 531 F 2d, at 813. The meager legislative history of the
amendment indicates that Congress was only providing an unequivocal
statement of its tent under Title III. See 115 Cong. Rec. 37192 (1969)
(remarks of Sen. McClellan). We decline to mfer from a congressional
grant of authority under these circumstances that such authority was
previously lacking. See FTC v Dean Foods Co., 384 U. 8. 597, 608-612
(1966), Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U. S. 33, 47 (1959)

Moreover, even if Congress’ action were viewed as indicating acceptance
of the Ninth Circuit’s view that there was no authority for the issuance of
orders compelling telephone companies to provide assistance in connection
with wiretaps without an explicit statutory provision, it would not follow
that explicit congressional authorization was also needed to order telephone
companies to assist in the installation and operation of pen registers which,
unlike wiretaps, are not regulated by a comprehensive statutory scheme.
In any event, by amending Title ITI Congress has now required that at
the Government’s request telephone companies be directed to provide

I agree that the use of pen registers is not governed by the
requirements of Title III and that the District Court had
authority to issue the order authorizing mstallation of the pen
register, and so Jom Parts I, Ii, and III of the Court’s opmion.
However, I agree with Mr. Justice Srevens that the District
Court lacked power to order the telephone company to assist
the Government in installing the pen register, and thus jom
Part II of his dissenting opinion.

Mr. Justice Stevens, with whom Mr. Justics Brennan
and Mr. Justice MarsHA.u jo, dissenting in part.

Today’s decision appears to present no radical departure
from this Court’s prior holdings. It builds upon previous
intimations that a federal district court’s power to issue a
search warrant under Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 41 1s a flexible
one, not strictly restramed by statutory authorization, and it
applies the same flexible analysis to the All Writs Act, 28
U S.C. §1651 (a) But for one who thmks of federal courts
as courts of limited jurisdiction, the Court’s decision 1s difficult

assistance m connection with wire mterceptions. It is plamly unlikely
that Congress intended at the same time to leave federal courts without
authority to require assistance m connection with pen registers.

to accept. The prmeiple of limited federal jurisdiction is
fundamental, never 1s 1b more mmportant than when a federal
court purports to authorize and implement the secret mvasion
of an individual’s privacy Yet that principle was entirely
ignored on March 19 and April 2, 1976, when the District
Court granted the Government’s application for permission to
engage in surveillance by means of a pen register, and ordered
the respondent to cooperate m the covert operation.

Congress has not given the federal district courts the power
either to authorize the use of a pen register, or to require private
parties to assist m carrying out such surveillance. Those de-
fects cannot be remedied by a patchwork interpretation of Rule
41 which regards the Rule as applicable as a grant of authority,
but imapplicable msofar as it limits the exercise of such
authority Nor can they be corrected by reading the All
Writs Act as though it gave federal judges the wide-rangmg
powers of anombudsman. The Court’s decision may be moti-
vated by a belief that Congress would, if the question were
presented to 1t, authorize both the pen register order and the
order directed to the Telephone Company? But the history
and consistent mterpretation of the federal court’s power to
issue search warrants conclusively show that, m these ereas,
the Court’s rush to achieve a logical result must await con-
gressional deliberation. From the begmning of our Nation’s
history, we have sought to prevent the accretion of arbitrary
police powers in the federal courts, that accretion is no less
dangerous and unprecedented because the first step appears to
be only mmmally intrusrve.

power to issue search warrants of one form or another. These
statutes have one characteristic m common. they are specific
in their grants of authority and m their inclusion of limitations
on either the places to be searched, the objects of the search,
or the requirements for the issuance of a warrant.? This 1s
not a random comeidence, 1t 1s a reflection of a concern deeply
imbedded in our revolutionary history for the abuses that
attend any broad delegation of power to issue search warrants.
In the colomial period, the oppresstve British practice of
allowing courts to issue “general warrants” or “writs of assist-
ance”* was one of the major catalysts of the struggle for
independence.* After dependence, one of the first state
constitutions expressly provided that “no warrant ought to
be issued but in cases, and with the formalities, prescribed by
the laws.”* This same principle motivated the adoption of

2The statutes enacted prior to 1945 are catalogued in the Appendix to
Mr. Justice Frankfurter’s eloquent dissent m Davis v United States, 328
U.S. 582, 616-623.

3 These writs authonzed the mndiscrmunate search and seizure of unde-
scribed persons or property based on mere suspicion. See N. Lasson, The
History and Development of the Fourth Amendment to the United States
Constitution 51-55 (1937) The writs of assistance were viewed as par-
ticularly oppressive. They commanded “all officers and subjects of the
Crown to assist m their execution,” and they were not returnable after
execution, but rather served as continuous authority during the lifetime of
the reignmg sovereign. Id., at 53-54.

+The mmportance of the colomal resistance to general writs and writs of
assistance m our history has been emphasized mm several Supreme Court
cases, e. g., Frank v Maryland, 359 U.S. 360, 363-365, Henry v United
States, 361 U.S. 98, 100-101, Stanford v Texas, 379 U. 8. 476, 481-485,

the Fourth Amendment and the contemporaneous, specific
legislation limiting judicial authority to issue search warrants.°

It 1s unnecessary to develop this historical and legislative
background at any great length, for even the rough contours
make 1t abundantly clear that federal judges were not mtended
to have any roving commission to issue search warrants.
Quite properly, therefore, the Court today avoids the error
committed by the Courts of Appeals which have held that a
district court has “inherent power” to authorize the installa-
tion of a pen register on a private telephone line.’ Federal
courts have no such mmherent power.®

SJé was not until 1917 that Congress granted the federal courts, as part
of the Espionage Act, broad powers to issue search warrants. 40 Stat.
217, 228 (allowmg warrants for stolen property, property used in the
commission of a felony, and property used to unlawfully aid a foreign
government). These provisions of the Espionage Act formed the basis of
Rule 41. See Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules, 18 U.S. C. App.,
p. 4512. It is clear that the Espionage Act did not delegate authority to
issue all warrants compatible with the Fourth Amendment. After the
Act, Congress continued to enact legislation authorizing search warrants
for particular items, and the courts recognized that, if a warrant was not
specifically authorized by the Act—or another congressional enactment—
it was prohibited. See Colyer v. Skeffington, 265 F 17, 45 (Mass. 1920),
rev'd on other grounds, 277 F 129 (CA1 1922). See also Warden v.
Hayden, 387 U.S. 294, 308 n. 12.

7See United States v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 546 F 2d 248, 245
(CA8 1976), United States v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., 531 F 2d 809 (CA7
1976) (semble).

8TI recognize that there are opimons involving warrantless electrome
surveillance which assume that courts have some sort of nonstatutory
power to issue search warrants. See United States v Giordano, 416 U.S.
505, 554 (Powett, J., concurring), Kate v. United States, 389 U. 8. 347,
Osborn v United States, 385 U. 8. 323. That assumption was not, how-
ever, necessary to the decisions in any of those cases, and Katz may rest
on a reading of Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 41, see discussion, fra, at 184-185.
Admittedly, Osborn appears to rely m part on a nonstatutory order
to permit a secret recording of a conversation with a lawyer who attempted
to bribe a witness. But, as the Court subsequently made clear m United
States v White, 401 U.S. 745, prior judicial authorization was not a neces-
sary element of that case. Moreover, smce the court m Osborn was
182 OCTOBER TERM, 1977
Stevens, J., dissenting m part 434U.8.

While the Court’s decision eschews the notion of mherent
power, 1ts holding that Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 41 authorizes the
District Court’s pen register order 1s equally at odds with the
200-year history of search warrants m this country and ignores
the plam meaning and legislative history of the very Rule on
which it relies. Under the Court’s reading of the Rule, the
definition of the term “property” m the Rule places no limits
on the objects of a proper search and seizure, but 1s merely
illustrative. Ante, at 169. The Court treats Rule 41 as
though it were a general authorization for district courts to
issue any warrants not otherwise prohibited. Ante, at 170.
This 1s a startling approach. On 1ts face, the Rule grants no
such open-ended authority Instead, it follows in the steps of
the dozens of enactments that preceded it. It limits the nature
of the property that may be seized and the circumstances under
which a valid warrant may be obtamed. The continuing
force of these limitations 1s demonstrated by the congressional
actions which compose the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe
Streets Act of 1968.

In Title III of that Act, Congress legislated comprehensively
on the subject of wiretappmg and electrome surveillance.
Specifically, Congress granted federal judges the power to
authorize electronic surveillance under certam carefully de-
fined circumstances. As the Court demonstrates m Part II of
zis opmion (which I joi), the mstallation of pen register
devices 1s not encompassed withm that authority What the
majority opmion fails to pomt out, however, 1s that mn Title
IX of that same Act, Congress enacted another, distmcet provi-

concerned with the integrity of its own procedures, the argument that it
possessed an herent power to authonze a nonstatutory mvestigation had
far greater strength than it has m the context of an ordinary crmunal
investigation. Cf. American Tobacco Co. v Werckmesster, 146° F 375

warrants. That statute, which formed the basis of the 1972
amendment to Rule 41, authorized the issuance of search war-
rants for an additional class of property, namely, “property
that constitutes evidence of a criminal offense 1n violation of
the laws of the United States.” 18 U S.C. §31038a. In order
to understand this provision, it must be remembered that, prior
to 1967, “mere evidence” could not be the subject of a consti-
tutionally valid seizure. Gouled v United States, 255 U.S.
298. In Warden v Hayden, 387 U S. 294, this Court removed
the constitutional objection to mere-evidence seizures. ‘Title
IX was considered necessary because, after Warden v Hayden,
there existed a category of property—mere evidence—which
could be the subject of a valid seizure meident to an arrest,
but which could not be seized pursuant to a warrant. The
reason mere evidence could not be seized pursuant to a warrant
was that, as Congress recognized, Rule 41 did not authorize
warrants for evidence.® Title IX was enacted to fill this gap
m the law”

°In the edition of his treatise written after the decision m Warden v.
Hayden m 1967 and prior to the 1972 amendment to Rule 41, Professor
Wright acutely observed:

“Immediately after the Hayden decision there was an apparent anomaly,
since the case held that evidence might be seized, but Rule 41 (b) did not
authorize issuance of a search warrant for evidence. This would have
meant that evidence might be seized where a search may permussibly be
made without a warrant, but not m a search under warrant. This would
have been wholly mconsistent with the strongly-held notion that, save m
a few special classes of cases, a warrant should be a prerequisite to a search,
and it would have encouraged police to search without a warrant.
Congress, which can move more quickly than the rulemaking apparatus,
responded by passage of a statute making it permissible to issue a search
warrant for ‘property that constitutes evidence of a crimmal offense in
violation of the laws of the United States.’ This supplements, and may
well soon swallow up, the other grounds for a search warrant set out mm
Rule 41 (b).” (Footnotes omitted.) 3 C. Wnght, Federal Practice and

Two conclusions follow imeluctably from the congressional
enactment of Title IX. First, Rule 41 was never mtended to
be a general authorization to issue any warrant not otherwise
prohibited by the Fourth Amendment. If 1t had been, Con-
gress would not have percerved a need to enact Title IX,
smce constitutional law, as 1t stood m 1968, did not prohibit
the issuance of warrants for evidence.”

Second, the enactment of Title IX disproves the theory
that the definition of “property” m Rule 41 (h) 1s only illus-
trative. This suggestion was first put forward by the Court in
Katz v United States, 389 U S. 347 The issue was not
briefed in Katz, but the Court, m dicta, mdicated that Rule 41
was not confined to tangible property Whatever the merits
of that suggestion in 1967, 1t has absolutely no force at this
time. In 1968 Congress comprehensively dealt with the issue
of electronic searches in Title III. In the same Act, it provided
authority for expanding the scope of property covered under
Rule 41. But the definition of property im the Rule has never
changed. Each item listed 1s tangible,” and the final reference
to “and any other tangible 1tems” surely must now be read as
describing the outer limits of the meluded category * Itstrams

11 Indeed, under the Court’s flexible mterpretation of Rule 41, the entire
series of statutes that belie the “inherent power” concept, was also an
exercise mm futility because the silence of Congress would not have pro-
hibited any warrant that did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Many of
these statutes remain in effect, e. g., 49 U S. C. § 782 (seizure of certam
contraband), 19 U S. C. $1595 (customs duties; searches and seizures) ,
and Rule 41 (h) expressly provides that Rule 41 “does not modify any
act, mconsistent with it, regulating search, seizure and the issuance and
execution of search warrants 2B

12 Rule 41 (h) provides m part:

“The term ‘property’ 1s used m this rule to mclude documents, books,
papers and any other tangible objects.”

18The Court acknowledges that the amendment to Rule 41 (b)
elimmated a “restriction” agamst the seizure of mere evidence. Ante, at
170-171, n. 18. What the Court refers to as a “restriction” was nothing
more than silence—the absence of an express grant of authority Since the

credulity to suggest that Congress, having carefully cxreum-
scribed the use of electronic surveillance m Title III, would
then, m Title IX, expand judicial authority to issue warrants
for the electronic seizure of “intangibles” without the safe-
guards of Title III7* In fact, the safeguards contamed m
Rule 41 make 1t absurd to suppose that its draftsmen thought
they were authorizing any form of electronic surveillance.
The paragraphs relating to issuance of the warrant, Rule
41 (c), the preparation of an mventory of property m the
presence of the person whose property has been taken, Rule
41 (d), and the motion for a return of property, Rule 41 (e),
are almost meaningless if read as relating to electronic sur-
veillance of any kind.

To reach its result in this case, the Court has had to overlook

Rule 1s just as silent on the subject of seizing intangibles as it was on the
subject of seizing mere evidence, it 1s difficult to understand why the
Court does not recognize the same “restriction” against such seizures.

14 The Court argues that it “would be anomalous to permit the recording
of conversations by means of electronic surveillance while prohibiting the
far lesser mtrusion accomplished by pen registers.” Ante, at 170. But
respondent does not claim that Congress has prohibited the use of pen
registers. Admittedly there 1s now no statute either permitting or pro-
hibiting the use of such devices. If that use 1s a “search” withm the
meaning of the Fourth Amendment—a question the Court does not decide—
there 1s nothmg anomalous about concluding that it 1s a forbidden activity
until Congress has prescribed the safeguards that should accompany any
warrant to engage mit. Even if an anomaly does exist, it should be cured
by Congress rather than by a loose interpretation of “property” under
Rule 41 which may tolerate sophisticated electronic surveillance techniques
never considered by Congress and presenting far greater dangers of ntru-
sion than pen registers. See Michigan Bell Tel. Co. v. United States,
565 F 2d 385 (CA6 1977) (indicating the mereasing sophistication of
surveillance techniques similar to pen registers), cf. United States v.
Pretznger, 542 F 2d 517 (CA9 1976) (use of electromic tracking devices).
It is significant that Title III limits the types of ermmal mvestigations for
which electronic surveillance may be used; no such limit 1s expressed in
Rule 41 or 1s implicit m the Court’s reasonmg today

the Rule’s specific language, its specific safeguards, and
its legislatrve background. This is an extraordinary judicial
effort in such a sensitive area, and I can only regard 1t as most
unwise. It may be that a pen register is less mmtrusive than
other forms of electromic surveillance. Congress evidently
thought so. See 8. Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 90
(1968) But the Court should not try to leap from that
assumption to the conclusion that the District Court’s order
here 1s covered by Rule 41. As I view this case, it 1s zmma-
terial whether or not the attachment of a pen register to a
private telephone line 1s a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
If, on the one hand, the mdividual’s privacy interest 1s not
constitutionally protected, judicial intervention 1s both unnec-
essary and unauthorized. If, on the other hand, the constitu-
tional protection 1s applicable, the focus of mquiry should not
be whether Congress has prohibited the mtrusion, but whether
Congress has expressly authorized it, and no such authoriza-
tion can be drawn from Rule 41. On either hypothesis, the
order entered by the District Court on March 19, 1976,
authorizmg the mstallation of a pen register, was a nullity
It cannot, therefore, support the further order requrmg the
New York Telephone Company to aid in the imstallation of
the device.
t

Even if I were to assume that the pen register order in this
case was valid, I could not accept the Court’s conclusion that
the District Court had the power under the All Writs Act, 28
U 8. C. § 1651 (a), to require the New York Telephone Com-
pany to assist m rts installation. This conclusion is unsup-
ported by the history, the language, or previous judicial
mterpretations of the Act.

The All Writs Act was originally enacted, in part, as § 14 of
the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 812" The Act was, and

15 The statute was also derrved from § 13 of the Judiciary Act, which

1s, necessary because federal courts are courts of linmuted juris-
diction having only those powers expressly granted by Con-
gress7° and the statute provides these courts with the
procedural tools—the various historie common-law writs—
necessary for them to exercise thew limited Jumsdiction2” The
statute does not contam, and has never before been mterpreted
as contammg, the open-ended grant of authority to federal
courts that today’s decision purports to uncover. Instead, m
the language of the statute itself, there are two fundamental
limitations on its scope. The purpose.of any order authorized
by the Act must be to aid the court in the exercise of its
jurisdiction, ** and the means selected must be analogous to
a common-law writ. The Court’s opmion ignores both
limitations.

dealing with writs of ne exeat, 1 Stat. 334. The All Writs Act now reads:

“(a) The Supreme Court and all courts established by Act of Congress
may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective
jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law ”

16 This proposition was so well settled by 1807 that Mr. Chief Justice
Marshall needed no citation to support the followmg statement:

“As prelimmary to any investigation of the merits of this motion, this
court deems it proper to declare that it disclaims all jurisdiction not given
by the constitution, or by the laws of the United States.

“Courts which originate in the common law possess a jurisdiction which
must be regulated by their common law, until some statute shall change
their established principles;. but courts which are created by written law,
and whose jurisdiction is defined by written law, cannot transcend that
jurisdiction. It 1s unnecessary to state the reasoning on which this opmion
is founded, because it has been repeatedly given by this court; and with
the decisions heretofore rendered on this pot, no member of the bench
has, even for an instant, been dissatisfied.” 2x parte Bollman, 4 Cranch
75, 98.

27 See Harris v. Nelson, 394 U.S. 286, 299.

18 This Court has frequently considered this requirement m the context
of orders necessary or appropnate mm the exercise of appellate yurisdic-
tion. See J. Moore, B. Ward, & J. Lucas, 9 Moore’s Federal Practice
4] 110.27-110.28 (1975). Here, we are faced with an order that must be
necessary or appropriate m the exercise of a district court’s omgimal
jurisdiction.
188 OCTOBER TERM, 1977
Stevens, J., dissenting m part 434 U.S.

The Court starts from the premise that a district court may
issue a writ under the Act “to effectuate and prevent the
frustration of orders 1t has previously issued im its exercise of
jurisdiction otherwise obtained.” Ante,at 172. Asstated, this
premise is neither objectionable nor remarkable and conforms
to the prinerple that the Act was mtended to aid the court
in the exercise of 1ts jurisdiction. Clearly, if parties were free
to ignore a court judgment or order, the court’s ability to
perform its duties would be undermmed. And the court’s
power to issue an order requirmg a party to carry out the
terms of the original judgment 1s well settled. See Root v
Woolworth, 150 U 8. 401, 410-413. The courts have also
recognized, however, that this power 1s subject to certam
restraints. For mstance, the relief granted by the wrt may
not be “of a different kind” or “on a different prierple” from
that accorded by the underlymg order or Judgment. See 2d.,
at 411-412."

19 These restramts are necessary concomitants of the undisputed fact
that the All Writs Act does not provide federal courts with an independent
grant of jurisdiction. McIntire v Wood, 7 Cranch 504, Rosenbaum v
Bauer, 120 U. S. 450. The factors mentioned above may be relevant in
determining whether the court has ancillary yunsdiction over the dispute.
See Dugas v. American Surety Co. 300 U. S. 414, Labette County
Commr’s v. Moulton, 112 U 8. 217, Morrow v District of Columbia,
185 U 8. App. D. C. 160, 417 F 2d 728 (1969) In this case, the
Distmet Court’s order was entered against a third party—the Telephone
Company ‘The Court never explains on what basis the District Court had
jurisdiction to enter this order. Possibly, the District Court believed that
it had ancillary junsdiction over the controversy, or that the failure of
the Company to aid the Government posed a federal question under 28
U.S. C. $1831. See Board of Education v York, 429 F 2d 66 (CA10
1970), cert. demed, 401 U 8S. 954. Since I believe that the District Court
could not enter its order m any event smce it was not m aid of its
jurisdiction, I do noé find it necessary to reach the question whether there
was jurisdiction, apart from the All Writs Act, over the “dispute” between
the Government and the Telephone Company However, the Court’s
failure to indicate the basis of jurisdiction 1s mexplicable.
UNITED STATES v. NEW YORK TELEPHONE CO. 189
159 Stevens, J., dissenting m part

More significantly, the courts have consistently recognized
and applied the limitation that whatever action the court takes
must be in aid of its duties and its jurisdiction.” The fact
that a party may be better able to effectuate its mghts or
duties if a writ 1s issued never has been, and under the lan-
guage of the statute cannot be, a sufficient basis for issuance
of the writ. See Sampson v Murray, 415 U S. 61, Commer-
cal Security Bank v Walker Bank & Trust Co., 456 F 2d 1852
(CA10, 1972), J Moore, B. Ward, & J Lucas, 9 Moore’s
Federal Practice J 110.29 (1975)

Nowhere in the Court’s decision or m the decisions of the
lower courts 1s there the slightest mdication of why a writ 1s
necessary or appropriate im this case to aid the District
Court’s jurisdiction. According to the Court, the writ 1s
necessary because the Company’s refusal “threatened obstruc-

20 The Court’s failure to explam why the District Court’s order was m
aid of its jurisdiction 1s particularly notable when compared to the
rationale of the prior Court cases on which it relies. See, e. g., Harns v
Nelson, 394 U. S. 286, 299 (“the habeas corpus jurisdiction and the duty
to exercise it beg present, the courts may fashion appropriate modes of
procedure Where thew duties requre it, this 1s the mescapable
obligation of the courts”) (emphasis added), FTC v Dean Foods Co.,
384 U. §. 597, 604 (injunction issued under All Writs Act upheld
because it was necessary “to preserve the status quo while administrative
proceedings are mn progress and prevent ympairment of the effective exercise
of appellate jurisdiction”) (emphasis added)

The Court apparently concludes that there is no functional distinction
between orders designed to enable a party to effectuate its nghts and
orders necessary to aid a court in the exercise of its yumsdiction. Ante,
at 175 n, 23. The Court reaches this conclusion by pomting out that the
orders m cases such as Harns v. Nelson, supra, protected a party’s nghts.
This 1s, of course, true. Orders in aid of a court’s junsdiction will
usually be beneficial to one of the parties before the court. The con-
verse, however, 1s clearly not true. Not all orders that may enable a
party to effectuate its mghts aid the court m its exercise of junsdiction.

tion of an mvestigation ” Ante, at 174. Concededly,
citizen cooperation 1s always a desired element in any govern-
ment mvestigation, and lack of cooperation may thwart such
an investigation, even though 1% 1s legitimate and judicially
sanctioned.* But unless the Court 1s of the opmion that the
District Court’s interest in its jurisdiction was coextensive
with the Government’s mterest im a successful investigation,
there 1s simply no basis for concluding that the mability of
the Government to achieve the purposes for which 1t obtamed
the pen register order 1n any way detracted from or threat-
ened the District Court’s yurisdiction. Plamly, the District
Court’s jurisdiction does not ride on the Government’s
shoulders until successful completion of an electronic
surveillance.

If the All Writs Act confers authority to order persons to
aid the Government in the performance of its duties, and is
no longer to be confined to orders which must be entered to
enable the court to carry out 1ts functions, 1t provides a sweep-
ing grant of authority entirely without precedent m our
Nation’s Instory Of course, there 1s precedent for such
authority in the common law—the writ of assistance. The use
of that writ by the judges appomted by King George ITI was
one British practice that the Revolution was specifically
mtended to terminate. See n. 3, supra. I can understand
why the Court today does not seek to support its holding by
reference to that writ, but I cannot understand tts disregard
of the statutory requirement that the writ be “agreeable to
the usages and principles of law ”

21 A citizen 1s not, however, free to forcibly prevent the execution of a
search warrant. Title 18 U.S. C. § 2231 mmposes crimmal penalties on any
person who “forcibly assaults, resists, opposes, prevents, umpedes, mtimi-
dates, or mterferes with any person authorized to serve or execute search
warrants »” This section was origmally enacted as part of the
Espionage Act of 1917, see n. 6, supra, and is the only statutory provision
mmposmg any duty on the general citizenry to “assist” m the execution
of a warrant.

TIT

The order directed agamst the Company in this case 1s not
particularly offensive. Indeed, the Company probably wel-
comes its defeat since 1t will make a normal profit out of com-
pliance with orders of this kind in the future. Nevertheless,
the order 1s deeply troubling as a portent of the powers that
future courts may find lurking im the arcane language of
Rule 41 and the All Writs Act.

I would affirm the yudgment of the Court of Appeals.
