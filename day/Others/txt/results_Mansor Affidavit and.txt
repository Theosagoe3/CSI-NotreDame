) ss. , AFFIDAVIT FOR SEARCH WARRANT

County of Washington)

TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE

I, the undersigned, upon my oath, do hereby depose and say that 1, Robert L. Rookhuyzen, am employed
as a Detective with the child abuse unit of the Washington County Sheriffs Office. I have been employed full-
time as a police officer with this agency since September 2001. I hold an advanced police certificate from the
Oregon Department of Public Safety Standards and Training (DPSST). 1 possess a bachelor of science degree in
Sociology from Brigham Young University. | am a 2002 graduate of the Oregon Department of Public Safety
Standards and Training basic police academy. During my career, I have received hundreds of hours of training
on various subjects, including many relating to the investigation of sex crimes and child abuse.

FACTS

 

This affidavit is for the limited purpose of securing a search warrant. Therefore, | am not including all
facts known to me, but rather sufficient facts to substantiate probable cause that the crimes of Criminal
Mistreatment I (Oregon Revised Statute 163.205) and Assault 1 (ORS 163.185) occurred at 9465 SW Sutton
Place in Tigard, Washington County, Oregon.

BACKGROUND

On Sunday, 6/12/11, at 2:22pm, Deputy Theresa Fichter (“Fichter”) with the Washington County

Sheriff's Office was dispatched to 9465 SW Sutton Place in unincorporated Washington County, Oregon.

Fichter was to assist medical personnel from Tualatin Valley Fire & Rescue (TVF&R) and Metro West

Ambulance, who were present on scene at that time. Kaliq Mansor (DOB: 11-22-1977) had called 911 to report
that his 11-week-old son, Bryan Mansor, had stopped breathing. Fichter arrived at the home at 2:26pm.

I arrived at the home at 2:38pm-and saw that Metro West Ambulance personnel were leaving with a
patient. The ambulance was followed by TVF&R unit C7 and Washington County Sheriff's Office Cpl. Erika
Wagner (“Wagner”) and Deputy V. Ferraris (“Ferraris”). I went into the home and contacted Kaliq Mansor
(“Mansor”). Mansor is the father of twins, Bryan P. Mansor (“Bryan”) and Ethan D. Mansor (“Ethan”), both
born on 3/28/11. He was sweating profusely and completely non-emotive. | found this highly unusual, based
on my fraining and experience. Parents are usually crying, sobbing, and exhibiting signs of sadness or anxiety.
INTERVIEW OF KALIO MANSOR

At approximately 2:45pm, I interviewed Mansor. He told me that he and his wife, Angela Mansor
(DOB: 11-24-1971) (“Angela”), live at the home with their two sons, Bryan and Ethan. There are no
roommates. There are two cats but no dogs in the home. He told me that Angela left the home about noon to
teach piano lessons. He said that she was expected home at any moment. Mansor told me that he had been
home alone with the babies while his wife was out teaching piano lessons. At the time of our interview, Mansor
told me that he had not yet called Angela to tell her about Bryan’s breathing difficulty. I also found this
extremely unusua]. Based on my experience with these kind of incidents, spouses want to call each other
instantly, even before speaking with Jaw enforcement.

Mansor took me to a room on the second floor. At the top of the stairs, it is the room and door to the
left. The room appeared to be a combination baby room/office space. The upstairs felt quite warm and it was

. especially warm in the combined office/baby room. An electronic thermostat in a baby crib read 76 degrees
fahrenheit. Ethan was in a baby seat on a bed in the middle of the room. He was quiet and in no apparent
distress.

Mansor told me that he-was feeding Bryan in the upstairs office/baby room. He said that he had mixed

liquid baby vitamins with some formula and fed it to Bryan. He described the mixture as being brown in color.

He showed me a small container, which ] saw was a 50m] container of Enfamil-brand “Poly-Vi-Sol with iron.”
Mansor told me that he used a separate bottle (different from the ones he uses to feed pure baby formula to the
boys) to give the vitamins, which he indicated to me that he used a clear plastic bottle with a green, screw-on
top to mix the two liquids. He told me that he uses a separate bottle to be certain of the quantity consumed by
the babies.

. (While in this room, I also saw a 30m! container labeled “Infants gas relief’ medication. It appeared to
be an over-the-counter medication. I also saw a container labeled Little Tummy’s-brand “gripe water.” I saw
various plastic droppers used to measure/administer medications/formula.]

He said that as he was feeding Bryan, he saw that Bryan was “fussing and was reluctant to take it.” He
said that Bryan coughed, then he saw the mixture of the vitamins and formula coming out of Bryan’s nose.
Mansor said that when he noticed this, he walked Bryan into the bathroom (just to the left of the office/baby
room). He said that he did not want the discharge to get onto the carpet. He told me that the discharge fell onto
the bathroom rug and into the tub.

He said that Bryan started coughing, so he “tumed him over, shook him,” and “smacked” him on the
back. He said that Bryan continued to expel the brown mixture from his nose and/or mouth. Mansor said,
“More came out while he was face down.” He said he wasn’t sure of the source, as he had Bryan turned upside
down. He told me that he had cleaned up the floor with a rag. He said he did not know what he had done with
that particular rag. [While in the bathroom, I saw brown liguid residue in the sink and in the bath tub. [ also
saw some brown liquid residue on at Jeast one of the two white rugs in the bathroom. J saw several rags in the
three rooms that might have been used for this purpose. }

He said that Bryan’s eyes “seemed fixed” and “droopy.” Mansor said that Bryan “wasn’t breathing very
much.” He clarified that Bryan’s breathing seemed “very much labored.” He said that he shook him some
more, which caused Bryan to gasp. Mansor said that Bryan “was going a minute or two between breaths.” At

this point, he took Bryan into the master bedroom (next door to the left of the bathroom).

Mansor said that Bryan’s “color still seemed okay.” He then gave Bryan “three or four breaths, but no
compressions,” as he believed Bryan to still have a pulse. He told me that he went online and researched what
he should do. lI noted an open laptop and two desktop computers in the office/baby room.] Mansor then said
that after “15 minutes,” he called 911, as Bryan’s condition “was not improving.”

He said that he declined cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) instructions from WCCCA. | asked him
whether he was “up to speed on CPR.” He said “No,” but said that he and Angela had attended an informational
class on the topic of pediatric CPR while at St. Vincent’s Hospital. He said that Bryan and Ethan had been born
prematurely and this topic was presented to them as parents.

He again told me that he had not as of yet informed his wife Angela of what had transpired. He said that
he “didn’t get a chance” to call her. He told me that his cell phone number was 503-804-2886 and his wife’s
cell phone number was 503-780-7169.

Mansor said that Bryan had been sleepy today and hadn’t wanted to eat much. He said there was no
abnormal behavior prior to this. He said that Bryan had an “inguinal hernia,” but did not provide further details.
REVIEW OF 911 CALL

Fichter went to the Washington County Consolidated Communications Agency (WCCCA} to listen to
the 911 call made by Mansor. Fichter told me that staff at WCCCA did not have access to the recorded call and
told her that the call may have been inadvertently deleted.

MEDICAL OPINION OF ABUSE

At 5:20pm, I spoke to Deputy Wagner, who was at Emanuel Children’s Hospital in Portland. She told
me that Dr. James Lindsay, MD, a pediatrician, had examined Bryan. Dr. Lindsay told Deputy Wagner that
during his examination of Bryan, he obeserved that Bryan had no brain activity. Dr. Lindsay told Dep, Wagner
that he has diagnosed Bryan as having suffered from shaken baby syndrome, and opined that the injuries to

Bryan were clearly the result of intentionally inflicted abuse.

Lp @ @

Furthermore, Lindsay told Wagner that Mansor’s version of events was not consistent with Bryan’s
condition. Dr, Lindsay said Bryan’s pupils were fixed and dilated and that this is a symptom or sign of a brain
injury and unrelated to choking. Lindsay found it concerning that Mansor went online instead of immediately
calling 911.

Dr. Lindsay further concluded that Bryan was “brain dead.” He concluded there was evidence of head
trauma, specifically a skull fracture with bi-hemispheric infarction. There were also bi-lateral retinal
hemorrhages. An examination also revealed an old rib fracture. The medical team determined that no medical
intervention can be done. Dr. Lindsay advised Deputy Wagner that he expects Bryan will die soon. Dr. Lindsay
stated that the hospital staff had alerted donor banks. ~

I know based upon my training and experience that itis critical in investigations of child physical abuse
that the scene be thoroughly documented. I know that in these types of investigations, the injury may be caused
by striking the child against walls, floors, or other hard objects. I know that skull fractures in children are
sometimes caused by the child’s head impacting a hard surface. | know that oftentimes items such as rags,
towels, or other materials can be used to clean up any bodily fluids that may have been expelled from the child
during and immediately following the assault. Mansor told me that he made efforts to clean up the bodily fluids
that Bryan had expelled, and ] saw some rags and towels inside the residence that may have been used to clean a
brown liquid substance in the sink, bathtub, and bathroom rug.

I know based upon my training and experience that computers can be connected to the internet to find
information using computer sofiware that browse internet sites for information. Internet search engine sites such
as Google and Yahoo! are often used to search the internet for information related to a user’s requests. | know
that the computer will retain a history of internet sites visited and the search terms used on the internet. | know
that to retain the integrity of a computer’s memory and how the system was used, the computer needs to be
searched in a laboratory and carefully examined by a trained computer forensic examiner in order to ensure that

the data is not corrupted, damaged, or otherwise changed from the time when the machine was seized. Mansor

told me that he searched the internet between the time he noticed Bryan was having difficulty breathing and the
time he called emergency dispatch. He told me that he was using a computer to search the internet for advice on
what he should do. When I was in the residence, I saw two laptop computers and two desktop computers.
Mansor did not specify which computer he was using just before he called 911.

I know from my training and experience that people use cell phones to maintain close contact with one
another. Especially parents of young children often give one another updates on the condition of their babies
when one is absent. I know people can use cell phones to speak to one another by voice transmissions, but also
cell phones can be used to text, or email a message to the other party.

I know that cell phones can retain some of this data internally, and that some of this data is maintained
by the cell phone service provider. I know that parents of injured children often call one another when their
child is hurt, and sometimes call one another before requesting emergency assistance. Mansor told me that both
he and his wife have cel] phones. 1 know based on my training and experience that suspects oftentimes use cell
phones to reach out to friends or family members to seek assistance when they believe that they are about to be
investigated for recent criminal activity.

1 know that the Northwest Regional Computer Forensic Laboratory has the capability to forensically
examine cellular phone in much the same way as a computer, That the cell phone needs to be examined in a
controlled setting by qualified personnel in order to preserve the integrity of the data.
