MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

qT. INTRODUCTION

In the hopes of gaining crucial evidence about the December 2;
2015 massacre in San Bernardino, California, the government has
sought to search a lawfully-seized Apple iPhone used by one of the
mass murderers. Despite both a warrant authorizing the search and
the phone owner’s consent, the government has been unable to
complete the search because it cannot access the iPhone’s encrypted
content. Apple has the exclusive technical means which would assist
the government in completing its search, but has declined to provide
that assistance voluntarily. Accordingly, the government
respectfully requests that this Court issue an order compelling
Apple to assist in enabling the search commanded by the warrant.
II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) is in possession of
a cellular telephone that was used by Syed Rizwan Farook (“Farook”),
one of the terrorists who caused the December 2, 2015 shooting death
of 14 people, and the shooting and injuring of 22 others, at the
Inland Regional Center (“IRC”) in San Bernardino, California. The
cellular telephone is of Apple make: iPhone 5C, Model: A1532, P/N:
MGFG2LL/A, S/N: FFMNQ3MTG2DJ, IMEI: 358820052301412, on the Verizon
Network (“the SUBJECT DEVICE”). The SUBJECT DEVICE was seized
pursuant to a federal search warrant for a black Lexus Is300 in
Docket Number ED 15-0451M, which was issued by the Honorable David
T. Bristow, United States Magistrate Judge, on December 3, 2015.
The underlying search warrant, which authorizes the search of the
contents of the SUBJECT DEVICE, is attached hereto as Exhibit 1 and

incorporated herein by reference,

As explained in the attached declaration of FBI Supervisory
Special Agent (“SSA”) Christopher Pluhar, the underlying search
warrant for the SUBJECT DEVICE arose out of an investigation into
the IRC shootings, and the participation by Farook and his wife,
Tafsheen Malik (“Malik”), in that crime. Subsequent to execution of
the search warrant at issue, the FBI obtained numerous search
warrants to search the digital devices and online accounts of Farook
and Malik. Through those searches, the FBI has discovered, for
example, that on December 2, 2015, at approximately 11:14 a.m., a
post on a Facebook page associated with Malik stated, “we pledge
allegiance to Khalifa bu bkr al bhaghdadi al quraishi,” referring to

Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi, the leader of Islamic State of Iraq and the

Levant (“ISIL”), also referred to as the Islamic State (“IS”), the
Islamic State of Iraq and al-sham (“ISIS”), or Daegh. ISIL,
formerly known as Al-Qai’da in Iraq (“AQI”), has been designated a

foreign terrorist organization by the United States Department of
State, and has been so designated since December 2004. Farook and
Malik died later that same day in a shoot-out with law enforcement.
The government requires Apple’s assistance to access the SUBJECT
DEVICE to determine, among other things, who Farook and Malik may
have communicated with to plan and carry out the IRC shootings,
where Farook and Malik may have traveled to and from before and
after the incident, and other pertinent information that would
provide more information about their and others’ involvement in the
deadly shooting.

The SUBJECT DEVICE is owned by Farook’s employer, the San
Bernardino County Department of Public Health (“SBCDPH”), and was

assigned to, and used by, Farook as part of his employment. The

SBCDPH has given its consent to the search of the SUBJECT DEVICE and
to Apple’s assistance with that search.?

However, despite the search warrant and the owner’s consent,
the FBI has been unable to search the SUBJECT DEVICE because it is
“locked” or secured with a user-determined, numeric passcode. More
to the point, the FBI has been unable to make attempts to determine
the passcode because Apple has written, or “coded,” its operating
systems with a user-enabled “auto-erase function” that would, if
enabled, result in the permanent destruction of the required
encryption key material after 10 erroneous attempts at the passcode
(meaning that after 10 failed attempts at inputting the passcode,
the information on the device becomes permanently inaccessible).
When an Apple iPhone is locked, it is not apparent from the outside
whether or not that auto-erase function is enabled; therefore,
trying repeated passcodes risks permanently denying all access to
the contents. Primarily because of this function and the delays
that would be introduced by successive incorrect passcodes
(discussed below), the government has not been able to attempt to

determine the passcode and decrypt the files on the SUBJECT DEVICE

 

pursuant to the search warrant, and the FBI cannot do go without
Apple’s assistance.

Apple is the manufacturer of the SUBJECT DEVICE, and the
creator and owner of its operating system and software. Apple has
the ability with older operating systems to obtain the unencrypted
file content from phones without the passcode, and has routinely

done so for law enforcement with a search warrant and accompanying

 

* In addition, SBCDPH has a written policy that all digital
devices are subject to search at any time by the SBCDPH, which
policy Farook accepted via signature upon his employment.

All Writs Act order. While Apple has publicized that it has written
the software differently with respect to iPhones such as the SUBJECT
DEVICE with operating system (“iOS”) 9, Apple yet retains the
capacity to provide the assistance sought herein that may enable the
government to access the SUBJECT DEVICE pursuant to the search
warrant.

Specifically, and as detailed below, Apple has the ability to
modify software that is created to only function within the SUBJECT
DEVICE that would ensure that the added auto-erase function is
turned off, allow for electronic submission of test passcodes, and
ensure additional delays are not created. This would allow the
government multiple investigative attempts to determine the passcode
in a timely manner, without fear that the data subject to search
under the warrant would be rendered permanently inaccessible. It is
this assistance from Apple, which is required to execute the search
warrant, that the government now asks the Court to order.

III. DISCUSSION

A. Assistance Sought From Apple

In sum, the government seeks an order that Apple assist in
enabling the search commanded by the warrant by removing, for the
SUBJECT DEVICE only, some of the additional, non-encryption barriers
that Apple has coded into its operating system, such as the auto-
erase function, the requirement that passwords be entered manually,
and any software-invoked delay-upon-failure functions. While the
government proposes a specific means of accomplishing this, the
government requests that the order allow Apple to achieve the goals
of the order in an alternative technical manner if mutually

preferable.

As an initial matter, the assistance sought can only be
provided by Apple. As discussed in the attached declaration of SSA
Pluhar, the SUBJECT DEVICE is an iPhone 5c that was designed,
manufactured, and sold by Apple. Apple also wrote and owns the
software operating system marketed under the name of “iOS,” and thus
is the owner of the Operating system software for the phone at
issue. Apple’s software licensing agreement specifies that its
software is “licensed, not sold,” and otherwise prohibits users from
transferring any ownership of the iOS software.

Further to this point, Apple strictly and exclusively controls
the hardware and software that is used to turn on and run its
phones. According to Apple’s “white papers” and other publicly
available information about the security of its i0S programs, Apple
has designed its mobile device hardware, as well as its operating
system software, to only permit and run software that has been
“signed” cryptographically by Apple using its own proprietary
encryption methods. These security features prevent other persons,
including the government, from running any other software on the
SUBJECT DEVICE to attempt to recover data or test passcodes.

Apple has designed the ios 9 operating system for its phones to
encrypt the data files by a combination of two components - one
user-determined passcode, and one unique 256-bit Advanced Encryption
Standard ("AES”) key (referred to as a “UID”) which is fuged into
the phone itself during manufacture. Both passcode components are
required in combination for the operating system to decrypt the
phone’s data files. When a user inputs her passcode, the phone

conducts a complex calculation as determined by Apple's software

(and unknown to the government) which combines the UID with the user
passcode. If the result is accurate, the data is decrypted.

If one does not know the user-determined passcode, it is
possible, although time-consuming, to manually input passcodes one
at a time until the passcode is determined. Apple, however, has
also designed and written code for additional non-encryption-based
features which the government cannot overcome on its own.

First, Apple has designed a non-encryption, auto-erase function
as part of its 10S, which destroys the encryption key materials
required for decryption and hence renders the contents of the device
permanently incapable of being decrypted after ten consecutive
incorrect passcode attempts. If this auto-erase function is
enabled, the operating system will instantly, irrecoverably, and
without warning erase the encryption keys necessary for accessing
stored data. There is no way to know by examining the outside of
the phone whether or not this function has been enabled, although,
in this instance, the government suspects that it has, for the
reasons explained in the attached declaration of SSA Pluhar -
including because the SBCDPH has stated that the SUBJECT DEVICE was
provided to Farook with that function turned on, and the most recent
backup from the iCloud showed the function turned on. Accordingly,
trying successive passcodes risks permanently losing the ability to
access the data on the SUBJECT DEVICE. Because ios software must be
cryptographically signed by Apple, only Apple is able to modify the
i0S software to change the setting or prevent execution of the
function.

Relatedly, Apple has designed and written code for another non-

encryption-based feature in that its ios operating system is coded

to invoke time delays after repeated, unsuccessful passcode entries,
This means that after each failed passcode entry, the user must wait
a period of time before another attempt can be made, up to a 11-hour
delay after the ninth failed attempt. Additional wait times can
also be added into the software.

In order to overcome these hurdles, the government seeks an
order requiring Apple to assist in the execution of a search warrant
using the capabilities that Apple has retained along within its
encryption software, such that the government can attempt to
determine the passcode without these additional, non-encryption
features that Apple has coded into its operating system, for the
SUBJECT DEVICE only. Apple’s assistance would permit the government
to electronically test passcodes. without unnecessary delay or fear
that the data subject to search under the warrant would be rendered
permanently inaccessible. Given that these features were designed
and implemented by Apple, that Apple writes and cryptographically
signs the iOS, and that Apple routinely patches or updates its ios
to address security features or other functionality, modifying these
features is well within its technical capabilities.

Specifically, in order to perform the search ordered in the
warrant, the government requests that Apple be ordered to provide
the FBI with a custom signed iPhone Software (“IPSW") file, recovery
bundle, or other Software Image File (“SIF”)? that can be loaded onto

the SUBJECT DEVICE. The SIF would load and run from Random Access

Memory (“RAM”)? and accordingly would not change the operating system

on the actual SUBJECT DEVICE, the user data partition (i.e., where

 

the contents of files created or modified by the user are stored),
or system partition on the device’s flash memory. Importantly, the

SIF would be created with a unique identifier of the SUBJECT DEVICE

 

so that the SIF would only load and execute on the SUBJECT DEVICE,‘
Once active on the SUBJECT DEVICE, the SIF would have three
primary functions: (1) the SIF would bypass or disable the auto-
erase function whether or not it has been enabled; (2) the SIF would
enable the FBI to submit passcodes to the SUBJECT DEVICE for testing
electronically (meaning that the attempts at the passcode would not
have to be manually typed on the iPhone’s screen; and (3) the SIF
would not introduce any additional delay between failed passcode
attempts beyond what is incurred by the hardware on the SUBJECT’

DEVICE. The SIF would be installed on the SUBJECT DEVICE at either

 

a government facility, or alternatively, at an Apple facility (as is
done when Apple recovers data from earlier ios versions), but
passcode attempts would be electronically submitted to the device by
the government. This would allow the government to conduct the
passcode attempts while Apple retains the SIF. The government

further requests that the order permit Apple to satisfy these three

 

> RAM is computer memory that is temporary and requires power to

maintain the stored information; once the power is turned off, the
memory is lost.

* since Apple’s software currently has the capability to query
hardware for unique identifiers (serial numbers, ECID, IMEI, etc.),
the SIF could be created to only function on the SUBJECT DEVICE,
which would mitigate any perceived risk to Apple iOS software as to
any other Apple device. As an alternative, the government would be
willing to test the passcodes remotely while the SUBJECT DEVICE is
in Apple's possession.

7 to the usages and principles of law.” 28 U.S.c. § 1651(a). As the

10 | Statute.” Pennsylvania Bureau of Correction v. United States
11 | Marshals Service, 474 U.S. 34, 43 (1985). The All Writs Act permits

12 a court, in its “sound judgment,” to issue orders necessary “to

14] to it.” United States v. New York Telephone Co., 434 U.S. 159, 172-

 

15/3 (1977) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Courts

technical assistance from provider of electronic communication
services to provide information, facilities, and technical
assistance to facilitate the consensual recording of all electronic
communication to and from a particular mobile phone); United States
v. Fricosu, 841 F.Supp.2d 1232, 1238 (D.Colo. 2012) (order issued
under All Writs Act requiring defendant to provide password to
encrypted computer seized pursuant to a search warrant). In New
York Telephone Co., the Supreme Court held that courts have
authority under the All Writs Act to issue supplemental orders to
third parties to facilitate the execution of search warrants. The
Court held that “[t]he power conferred by the Act extends, under
appropriate circumstances, to persons who, though not parties to the
original action or engaged in wrongdoing, are in a position to
frustrate the implementation of a court order or the proper
administration of justice, .. . and encompasses even those who have
not taken any affirmative action to hinder justice.” Id. at 174.

In particular, the Court upheld an order directing a phone company
to assist in executing a pen register search warrant issued under

Rule 41. See id. at 171-76; see also Application of U.S. for an

 

Order Authorizing an In-Progress Trace of Wire Comme’ns over Tel.

(affirming district court’s order compelling Mountain Bell to trace

telephone calls on grounds that “the obligations imposed . . . were
reasonable ones.” (citing New York Tel. Co., 434 U.S. at 172)).

New York Telephone Co. also held that “Rule 41 is not limited
to tangible items but is sufficiently flexible to include within its
scope electronic intrusions authorized by a finding of probable

cause.” 434 U.S. at 170. The Court relied upon the authority of a

search warrant pursuant to Rule 41 to predicate an All Writs Act
order commanding a utility to implement a pen register and trap and
trace device — before Congress had passed a law that specifically |
authorized pen registers by court order. Under New York Telephone
Co. and Mountain Bell, the All Writs Act provides authority for this
Court to order Apple to assist with steps necessary to perform the

search ordered by the warrant for the SUBJECT DEVICE.

 

Further, based on the authority given to the courts under the
All Writs Act, courts have issued orders, similar to the one the
government is seeking here, that require a manufacturer to assist in
accessing a cell phone’s files so that a warrant May be executed as

originally contemplated. See, e.g., In re Order Requiring [XXX],

 

Inc. to Assist in the Execution of a Search Warrant Issued by This

 

Court by Unlocking a Cellphone, 2014 WL 5510865, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.

 

Oct. 31, 2014); see also United States v. Navarro, No. 13-CR-5525,

 

ECF No. 39 (W.D. Wa. Nov. 13, 2013). Courts have also issued All
Writs Act orders in furtherance of warrants in a wide variety of
contexts, including: ordering a defendant to produce a copy of the
unencrypted contents of a computer seized pursuant to a federal
search warrant (Fricosu, 841 F.Supp. 2d at 1238); ordering a phone
company to assist with a trap and trace device (Mountain Bell, 616
F.2d 1122, 1129 (9th Cir. 1980)); ordering a credit card company to
produce customer records (United States v. Hall, 583 F. Supp. 717,
722 (E.D. Va. 1984)); ordering a landlord to provide access to
security camera videotapes (In re Application of United States for

an Order Directing X to Provide Access to Videotapes, No. 03-89,

In New York Telephone Co., the Supreme Court considered three
factors in concluding that the issuance of the All Writs Act order
to the phone company was appropriate. First, it found that the
phone company was not “so far removed from the underlying
controversy that its assistance could not be permissibly compelled.”
Id. at 174. Second, it concluded that the order did not place an
undue burden on the phone company. See id. at 175. Third, it

determined that the assistance of the company was necessary to

 

° The government is also aware of multiple other unpublished

orders in this district and across the country (obtained by ex parte
application) compelling Apple to assist in the execution of a search
warrant by accessing the data on devices running earlier versions of
i0S, orders with which Apple complied. The only exception known to
the government is litigation pending before a Magistrate Judge in
the Eastern District of New York, where that court sua sponte raised
the issue of whether it had authority under the All Writs Act to
issue a similar order. That out-of-district litigation remains
pending without any issued orders, nor would any such order be
binding on this court. In any event, those proceedings represent a
change in Apple’s willingness to access iPhones operating prior ios
versions, not a change in Apple’s technical ability. However, based
on that litigation and communications with Apple, the government
anticipates that Apple will avail itself of its ability to apply for
relief pursuant to the proposed order.

achieve the purpose of the warrant. See id. Each of these factors
supports issuance of the order directed to Apple in this case.
Ls Apple is not “far removed” from this matter

First, Apple is not “so far removed from the underlying
controversy that its assistance could not be permissibly compelled.”
Apple designed, manufactured and sold the SUBJECT DEVICE, and wrote
and owns the software that runs the phone — which software is
preventing the execution of the warrant. Indeed, Apple has
positioned itself to be essential to gaining access to the SUBJECT
DEVICE or any other Apple device, and has marketed its products on
this basis. Apple designed and restricts access to the code for the
auto-erase function — the function that makes the data on the phone
permanently inaccessible after multiple failed passcode attempts and
thus effectively prevents the government from attempting to execute
the search warrant without Apple's assistance. The same software
Apple is uniquely able to modify also controls the delays Apple
implemented between failed passcode attempts -- which makes the
process take too long to enable the access ordered by the court.
Especially but not only because iPhones will only run software
cryptographically signed by Apple, and because Apple restricts
access to the code of the software that creates these obstacles,
there is no other party that has the ability to assist the
government in preventing these features from obstructing the search
ordered by the court pursuant to the warrant.

Apple is also not made “far removed" by the fact that it is a

non-government third party. While New York Telephone Co. involved a

public utility, that was not the source of the holding that the All

Writs Act order was appropriate. New York Telephone Co. emphasized

that “the Company's facilities were being employed to facilitate a
criminal enterprise on a continuing basis,” and the company’s
noncompliance “threatened obstruction of an investigation which
would determine whether the Company's facilities were being lawfully
used.” New York Telephone Co., 434 U.S. at 174. By analogy, where
Apple manufactured and sold a phone used by a person at the center
of a terrorism investigation, where it owns and licensed the
software used to “facilitate the criminal enterprise,” where that
very software now must be used to enable the search ordered by the
warrant, compulsion of Apple is permissible under New York Telephone
Co. Moreover, other courts have directed All Writs Act orders based
on warrants to entities that are not public utilities. For example,
neither the credit card company in Hall nor the landlord in Access
to Videotapes was a public utility. See Hall, 583 F. Supp. at 722;
Access to Videotapes, 2003 WL 22053105, at *3. Apple's close
relationship to the iPhone and its software — which are by Apple's
design — makes compelling assistance from Apple permissible and the
only means of executing the warrant.

2 The order does not place an unreasonable burden on

 

Apple
Second, the order is not likely to place any unreasonable

burden on Apple. Where, as here, compliance with the order would
not require inordinate effort, and reasonable reimbursement for that
effort is available, no unreasonable burden can be found. New York
Telephone, 434 U.S. at 175 (holding that All Writs Act order was not
burdensome because it required minimal effort by the company,
provided for reimbursement for the company’s efforts, and did not

disrupt its business operations); Mountain Bell, 616 F.2d at 1132

(rejecting telephone company’s argument that unreasonable burden
would be imposed because of a drain on resources and possibility of
system malfunctions because the “Order was extremely narrow in
scope, restricting the operation to [electronic switching system]
facilities, excluding the use of manual tracing, prohibiting any
tracing technique which required active monitoring by company
personnel, and requiring that operations be conducted ‘with a
minimum of interference to the telephone service’”).

While the order in this case requires Apple to provide modified
software, modifying an operating system - writing software code - is
not an unreasonable burden for a company that writes software code
as part of its regular business. In fact, providers of electronic
communications services and remote computing services are sometimes
required to write code in order to gather information in response to
subpoenas or other process. In addition, the order is tailored for
this particular phone, and because it involves preparing a single
SIF, it presents no danger of system malfunctions or disrupting
business operations. As noted above, Apple designs and implements
all of the features discussed, writes and cryptographically signs
the i0S, and routinely patches security or functionality issues in
its operating system and releases new.versions of its operating
system to address issues. By comparison, writing a program that
turns off non-encryption features that Apple was responsible for

writing to begin with would not be unduly burdensome. °®

 

° It is worth noting as well that the user of the phone is now

dead, the user was made aware of his lack of privacy in the work
phone while alive, and the owner of the phone consents to both the
search of the phone and to Apple’s assistance in this matter.

4 However, to the extent that Apple believes that compliance with
2 the order would be unreasonably burdensome, it can make an

3 | application to the Court for relief prior to being compelled to

4 | provide the assistance. See In re XXX, 2014 WL 5510865, at *2

5] (including in the issued All Writs Act Order a provision that states
6 | that “to the extent [the manufacturer] believes that compliance with
7 | this Order would be unreasonably burdensome, it may delay compliance
g | provided it makes an application to the Court for relief within five
g | business days of receipt of the Order.”). The proposed order in

10 | this case includes a similar directive.

 

11 3. Apple's assistance is necessary to effectuate the
12 warrant
13 Third, Apple’s assistance is necessary to effectuate the

14 |) Warrant. In New York Telephone Co., the Court held that the order
15 /met that standard because “[t]he provision of a leased line by the
16 | Company was essential to the fulfillment of the purpose — to learn
17 | the identities of those connected with the gambling operation — for
1g | which the pen register order had been issued.” 434 U.S. at 175.

19 j Here, the proposed All Writs Act order in this matter also meets

20 | this standard, as it is essential to ensuring that the government is
21 | able to perform the search ordered by the warrant.

22 In this case, the ability to perform the search ordered by the
23 | Warrant on the SUBJECT DEVICE is of particular importance. The user
24 of the phone, Farook, is believed to have caused the mass murder of
25 |a large number of his coworkers and the shooting of many others, and
26 to have built bombs and hoarded weapons for this purpose. The

27 | government has been able to obtain several iCloud backups for the

28 | SUBJECT DEVICE, and executed a warrant to obtain all saved iCloud

16
Chse 5:15-mj-00451-DUTY “Document 18 Filed 02/16/16 Page 19 of 40 Page ID #:146

j | data associated with the SUBJECT DEVICE. Evidence in the iCloud

2 |) account indicates that Farook was in communication with victims who
3 | were later killed during the shootings perpetrated by Farook on

4 || December 2, 2015, and toll records show that Farook communicated

5 |} with Malik using the SUBJECT DEVICE. Importantly, however, the most
6 |, recent backup of the iCloud data obtained by the government was

7 | dated October 19, 2015, approximately one-and-a-half months before

gj} the shooting. This indicates to the FBI that Farook may have

9 | disabled the automatic iCloud backup function to hide evidence, and
10 | demonstrates that there may be relevant, critical communications and
11 | Gata around the time of the shooting that has thus far not been

12 | accessed, may reside solely on the SUBJECT DEVICE, and cannot be

13 | accessed by any other means known to either the government or Apple.
14 As noted above, assistance under the All Writs Act has been

15 | compelled to provide decrypted contents of devices seized pursuant
16 | to a search warrant. In Fricosu, a defendant's computer — whose

17 | contents were encrypted — was seized, and defendant was ordered

18 |} pursuant to the All Writs Act to assist the government in producing
19 |} a copy of the unencrypted contents of the computer. 841 F.Supp. 2d
20 Jat 1237 ("There is little question here but that the government
21} knows of the existence and location of the computer’s files. The
22 | fact that it does not know the specific content of any specific
33 documents is not a barrier to production.”). Here, the type of
24 | assistance does not even require Apple to assist in producing the
25 | unencrypted contents, the assistance is rather to facilitate the
26 | FBI's attempts to test passcodes.

1 DECLARATION OF CHRISTOPHER PLUHAR

2 I, Christopher Pluhar, being duly sworn, declare and state as

3 | follows:

4/1. INTRODUCTION

5 ds Iam a Supervisory Special Agent (“SSA”) with the Federal
6 | Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), and Director of the Orange County

7 || Regional Computer Forensics Laboratory, Orange, California

8 || (“OCRCFL”). The OCRCFL is a state of the art computer forensics

9 | laboratory comprised of task force officers from 15 agencies in

10 | orange, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, and Riverside Counties. The
11} laboratory specializes in the archival, preservation, and analysis
12 |} of items of digital evidence, including computers, mobile devices,
13 | removable media (thumb drives, CDs etc) and Audio/Video equipment.
14 oe I have been a computer forensic examiner for the FBI since
15] 2001, have attended 700+ hours of specialized training in

16 | computer/device forensics, and have certifications to conduct

17 | forensic analysis on Windows, Macintosh, and Linux/Unix systems, as
18 | well as mobile devices and cell phones. I have been the Director of
19 | the OCRCFL since November of 2013.

20 Bes I have consulted extensively with the FBI's Cryptographic
21 ]and Electronic Analysis Unit ("“CEAU") in this matter, and bring

22 | their experience to bear in this declaration.

23 | II. PURPOSE OF DECLARATION

24 4, This declaration is made in support of an application for
25 fan order by the Court compelling Apple Inc. (“Apple”) to assist the
26 | FBI in its effort to search of a cellular telephone, Apple make:

27 | iPhone 5C, Model: A1532, P/N:MGFG2LL/A, S/N: FFMNQ3MTG2Da,

28 IMET:358820052301412, on the Verizon Network (“SUBJECT DEVICE”).

1 |) IIL. SEIZURE AND EXAMINATION OF SUBJECT DEVICE

2 5 The SUBJECT DEVICE was seized pursuant to the search

 

3 | warrant in Case No. ED 15-0451M, issued by the Honorable David T.

4 |} Bristow, United States Magistrate Judge, on December 3, 2015. The

5 | SUBJECT DEVICE was found inside of the SUBJECT VEHICLE identified in
6 || the warrant. The underlying search warrant is attached hereto as

7 | Exhibit 1 and incorporated by reference.

8 6. I know based on my participation in this investigation and
9 | conversations with other involved agents and San Bernardino County
10 | Information Technology personnel, that the search warrant arose out

11 | of an investigation into the December 2, 2015 shooting death of 14
12 | people, and the shooting and injuring of 22 others, at the Inland

13 | Regional Center (*IRC”) in gan Bernardino, California, and the

14 | participation by Syed Rizwan Farook ("Farook’) and his wife Tafsheen
15 | Malik (“Malik”) in that crime. Subsequent to the search warrant at
16 | issue, the FBI has obtained numerous warrants to search the digital
17 | devices and online accounts of Farook and Malik. Through those

18 | searches the FBI has discovered, for example, that on December By

19 | 2015, at approximately 11:14 a.m., a post on a Facebook page

20 | associated with Malik stated, “We pledge allegiance to Khalifa bu

21 | bkr al bhaghdadi al quraishi,” referring to Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi,

22} the leader of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ("“ISIL”), also
23 | referred to as the Islamic State (“IS”), or the Islamic State of

24 | Traq and al-sham (“ISIS”), or Daesh. ISIL, formerly known as Al-
25 |Qa’ida in Iraq (“AQT”), has been designated a foreign terrorist

26 || organization by the United States Department of State and has been
27 | s0 designated since December 2004, Farook and Malik died later that

28 | same day in a shoot-out with law enforcement.

Case 5:15-mj-00451-DUTY ~ Document 18 Filed 02/16/16 Page 23 of 40 Page ID #:150

 

Ve The SUBJECT DEVICE is owned by Farook’s employer at the
San Bernardino County Department of Public Health (“SBCDPH”), and
was assigned to, and used by, Farook as part of his employment.
While the SBCDPH does not have access to the passcode to the phone,
it has given its consent to the search of it and to Apple's
assistance with that search.

8. The SUBJECT DEVICE is “locked” or secured with a numeric
passcode. I have been very involved in the attempts to gain access
to the locked phone and comply with the search warrant. With the
consent of the SBCDPH, I and other agents have been able to obtain
several iCloud backups for the SUBJECT DEVICE, and I am aware that a
warrant was executed to obtain from Apple all saved iCloud data

associated with the SUBJECT DEVICE. I know from speaking with other

 

FBI agents that evidence in the iCloud account indicates that Farook
was in communication with victims who were later killed during the
shootings perpetrated by Farook on December 2, 2015. In addition,
toll records show that Farook communicated with Malik using the

SUBJECT DEVICE between July and November 2015, but this information

 

is not found in the backup iCloud data. Importantly, the most
recent backup is dated October 19, 2015, which indicates to me that
Farook may have disabled the automatic iCloud backup feature
associated with the SUBJECT DEVICE. I believe this because I have
been told by SBCDPH that it was turned on when it was given to him,
and the backups prior to October 19, 2015 were with almost weekly
regularity. I further believe that there may be relevant, critical
communications and data on the SUBJECT DEVICE around the time of the
shooting which has thus far not been accessed, may reside solely on

the SUBJECT DEVICE, and cannot be accessed by any other means known
Case 5:15-mj-00451-DUTY ~ Document 18 Filed 02/16/16 Page 24 of 40 Page ID #:151

1} to either the government or Apple. In addition, I have personally
2 | examined two other mobile devices belonging to Farook that were

3 | physically destroyed and discarded in a dumpster behind the Farook
4 | residence.

5 Die I have explored other means of obtaining this information
6 || with employees of Apple and with technical experts at the FBI, and
7 | we have been unable to identify any other methods feasible for

8 | gaining access to the currently inaccessible data stored within the
9 | SUBJECT DEVICE.
10 | Iv. REQUESTED ASSISTANCE
il 10. %I know based on my training and experience, knowledge of
12 |this case and review of Apple’s publicly available information that

13 | the SUBJECT DEVICE is an iPhone 5c that was designed, manufactured,

 

14 | and sold by Apple. Apple also wrote and owns the software operating
15 | system marketed under the name of “iOS,” and thus is the owner of

16 | the operating system for the phone at issue. Apple’s software

17 | licensing agreement specifies that its software is “licensed, not

18 | sold,” and otherwise prohibits users from transferring any ownership
19 | of the i0S software.

20 il. Apple strictly controls the hardware and software that is
21 | used to turn on and run its phones. According to Apple's “white

22 | papers” and other publicly available information about the security
23 | of its i0S programs, Apple has designed its mobile device hardware
24 as well as its operating system software to only permit and run

25 | software that has been “signed” cryptographically by Apple using its
26 | own proprietary encryption methods, Apple has also added hardware-
27 | enforced features to the A6é processor found in the iPhone 5C which

28 | verifies software using Apple's cryptographic signature, ensuring

Case 5:15-mj-00451-DUTY “Document 18. Filed 02/16/16 Page 25 of 40 Page ID #:152

that Apple devices can only run verified/signed software during the
booting process (when the phone is being turned on). These features
prevent the government from running any other software on the
SUBJECT DEVICE to attempt to recover data.

i2. In addition, an iPhone 5c is encrypted by a combination of
two components - one user-determined passcode, and one unique 256-
bit Advanced Encryption Standard (“AES”) key (referred to as a
“UID") fused into the phone itself during manufacture. Both
passcode components are required in combination for the phone to
decrypt its contents. When a user inputs the user-determined
passcode, the phone conducts a complex calculation as determined by
Apple’s software (and unknown to the government) which combines the
UID with the user passcode. If the result is accurate, the data is
decrypted.

13. If one does not know the user-determined passcode, it is
possible, although time-consuming, to manually input passcodes one
at a time until the puss ded is determined. Apple, however, has
also designed and written code for additional non-encryption-based
features which the government cannot overcome on its own. First,
Apple has designed a non-encryption, auto-erase function as part of
its iOS, which destroys encryption key material required for
decryption, and hence renders the contents of the device incapable
of being decrypted after ten consecutive incorrect passcode
attempts. If this erase function is enabled, ioS will instantly,
irrecoverably, and without warning erase the encryption keys
necessary for accessing stored data. Because iOS software must be
cryptographically signed by Apple, only Apple is able to modify the

i0S software to change the setting or prevent execution of the
Chse 5:15-mj-00451-DUTY ~ Document 18 Filed 02/16/16 Page 26 of 40 Page ID #:153

1 | function. There is no way to know by examining the outside of the
2 | phone whether or not this function has been turned on in the SUBJECT
3 || DEVICE, although, in this instance, I suspect that it has because I
4 lam told by an employee of SBCDPH that the SUBJECT DEVICE was

5 | provided to Farook with the auto-erase function turned on, and I

6 | know from my review of the most recent backup from the iCloud that

7 it showed the function turned on.

8 14. Relatedly, Apple has designed and written code for another
9 | non-encryption based feature in that its ios operating system is
10 | coded to invoke time delays which escalate after repeated,

11 | unsuccessful passcode entries. This means that after each failed
12 | passcode entry, the user must wait a period of time before another
13 |} attempt can be made. From Apple documentation and testing, the time
14 | delays for the iPhone 5C are invoked by Apple software upon failed
15 | login attempts. Apple documentation states that the software

16 | invokes no delay for the first four attempts; a 1-minute delay after
17 | the fifth attempt; a 5-minute delay after the sixth attempt; a
18 | fifteen minute delays after the seventh and eight attempt; and a 1-
19 | hour delay after the ninth attempt. Additional wait times can also
20 | be added into the software.
21 15, In order to allow the government to perform the search
22 | ordered in the warrant, and the ability to test passcodes to decrypt
23 | the SUBJECT DEVICE without unnecessary delay or fear that the data
24 subject to search under the warrant would be rendered permanently
25 | inaccessible, the government requests that Apple be ordered to
26 | provide the FBI with a signed iPhone Software file, recovery bundle,
27 | or other Software Image File (“SIF”) that can be loaded onto the

28 | SUBJECT DEVICE. The SIF would load and run from Random Access

Memory (“RAM”) and would not modify the iOS on the actual phone, the
user data partition or system partition on the device’s flash
memory. The SIF would be coded by Apple with a unique identifier of
the phone so that the SIF would only load and execute on the SUBJECT
DEVICE. Since Apple's software currently has the capability to
query hardware for unique identifiers (serial numbers, ECID, IMEI,
etc.), the SIF could be created to only function on the SUBJECT
DEVICE, which would mitigate any perceived security risk to Apple
iOS software. The SIF would be loaded via Device Firmware Upgrade
(“DFU”) mode, recovery mode, or other applicable mode available to
the FBI. In addition, Apple could run the SIF from within its
facility, allowing passcodes to be tested electronically via remote
network connection.

16. Once active on the SUBJECT DEVICE, the SIF would have
three important functions: (1) the SIF would bypass or disable the
auto-erase function whether or not it has been enabled on the
SUBJECT DEVICE, meaning that multiple attempts at the passcode could
be made without fear that the data subject to search under the
warrant would be rendered permanently inaccessible; (2) the SIF
would enable the FBI to submit passcodes to the SUBJECT DEVICE for
testing electronically via the physical device port, Bluetooth, Wi-
Fi, or other protocol available on the SUBJECT DEVICE (meaning that
the attempts at the passcode would not have to be manually typed on
the phone’s screen), or alternately, Apple could be given the phone
as is done when Apple recovers data from earlier ios versions, but
provide the government remote access to the SUBJECT DEVICE through a
computer allowing the government to conduct passcode recovery

analysis. This would allow the government to conduct the analysis

without Apple actually providing the government with the SIF; and
(3) the SIF would not introduce any additional delay between
passcode attempts beyond what is incurred by the Apple hardware.

17. Based on my (and the CEAU’s) review of available
information about Apple’s programs, Apple has the technological
capability of providing this software without it being an undue
burden. Apple routinely patches security or functionality issues in
its iOS operating system and releases new versions of its operating
system to address issues. I know from my training and experience,
and that of my fellow agents, that providers of electronic
communications services and remote computing services sometimes must
write code in order to gather the information necessary to respond
to subpoenas and other process, and that this is not a large burden.

18. However, in an abundance of caution, the government also
requests that the order permit Apple to satisfy the three goals of
the SIF and the loading of the SIF onto the SUBJECT DEVICE in an
alternative technical manner if mutually preferable.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true
and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Executed on February 16, 2016, Riverside, California.
