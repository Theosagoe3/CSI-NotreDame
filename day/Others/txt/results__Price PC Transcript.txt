THE COURT: Now proceeding in cause 55D01-1611-MC-1805, in
the matter of Search Warrant. Now before the Court is deputy
prosecuting attorney Ms. Mellady, and has presented and tendered
to the Court, I guess, a request for a search warrant. How do
you wish to proceed?

MS. STARNES: Your Honor, I’d like to call my witness,
Detective Larry Sanders.

THE COURT: Okay, sir, why don’t you go ahead and raise
your right hand. Do you swear or affirm the testimony you’re
about to give in this matter is the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth?

MR. SANDERS: I do, Your Honor.

THE COURT: All right, you may proceed.

MS. STARNES: Thank you, Judge.

LARRY SANDERS, having first been duly worn upon his oath,
now testifies as follows:

DIRECT EXAMINATION:

QUESTIONING BY MS. STARNES:

Q. Please state your name.

A Larry D. Sanders, SANDERS.

Q. And where are you currently employed?

A Morgan County Sheriff’s Department since January 1, 1988.
Q. And in what capacity are you employed with the sheriff's
department?

A. I’m a Detective.

QO. How long have you been a detective?

Rew For over ten years.

Q. And are you a graduate of the Indiana Law Enforcement
Academy?

A. Yes ma’am, within one year of being hired.

Q. Okay and over the course of the past ten years as a

detective, have you continued to have all required trainings and

A. I’m currently up to date on all of my training, ma’am, plus
I have a little bit of extra.

Q. Okay. Thank you. All right. We’re here today on a second
search warrant request. We .. since Judge Foley didn’t hear the
previous search warrant request, can you give the Judge a
understanding of the other search warrant we had for to process
the crime scene in Mooresville, Indiana, and how you got
involved in that case?

A. Yes, Your Honor. Well I was contacted by our major crime
unit, at which time, Chad Richhart, Detective in Mooresville,
Your Honor, contacted me, asked to get a search warrant for 218
Springhill Drive in Mooresville, which is an apartment complex
in Mooresville. They had a suspicious death of a five year old
male, who was found in the morning by his mother at
approximately 10:30, they were notified. When they arrived, the
mother had blood on her, the deceased had blood on the face and

mouth areas, and it appeared that she’d been giving CPR, mouth

to mouth, to the deceased. The child was taken to St. Francis
Hospital where it was declared dead by the doctors. We got a
search warrant to process the apartment because due to the fact
that the child was sleeping on an upper bunk, and at some time
had bled during the night and blood had dripped down from the
upper bunk to the lower bunk, to the floors, and we are
processing it as a crime scene. And at which time we have the
mother, who’s Meghan Price, phone, and we’re asking to doa
forensic search of the phone for any ingoing, outcoming calls or
text messages that happened during this time period.

Q. So this investigation has been .. just started this morning
around 10:30 is when the initial call came in?

A. Yes ma’am.

Q. Okay. And so specifically what Sue go looking for on the
phone to help you in your investigation, or what contact, if
any, information have you gotten from mother with regards to the
phone?

A. I did not interview her, Detective Richhart had interviewed
her, which he secured her phone. We’re asking to look for any
ingoing, outcoming phone calls, Your Honor, to see if we can do
a timeline of possibly when she first noticed this and when she
called 911 or notified law enforcement or medical personnel to
come in, because her story is, from what I understand, is that
she just discovered her son laying in the bed, and he wasn’t

breathing, and unresponsive.

QO. And you indicated that the crime scene, there was blood in
more than one spot, in the bedroom, is that correct?
A. Yes ma’am.

O. And there was also blood on the child and blood on the

mother?
Aw Yes.
Ce So that would indicate that potentially her story would not

match up with the blood events?
As We .. I don’t know ..

O. You're not sure? That’s what they are trying to figure out

A. We’re trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together at
this time, ma’‘am. And also, Your Honor, Detective Downing
advised me that the body was, the best way I can put it, was so
stiff of rigor mortis that the mother or someone had made a
statement that they had to pry the mouth open with a screwdriver
so they could do CER.

Ox Okay. And Detective Downing was a Coroner for several
years before becoming a Detective, is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay, so he’d be familiar with what rigor mortis is and how
long that process takes to set in.

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. So, securing .. after securing the search warrant

and for the crime scene this morning, was there any specific

reason that led us to the next search warrant being for mother’s
phone, or is this just a normal course of your investigation,
trying to gather information as to what occurred this morning in
this house?

A. It’s normal course of our investigation. We have a phone,
we're trying to cross all of our T’s and dot all of our I's,
ma’am. Basically, Your Honor, we're trying to verify her story,
i.e. that at such time she called law enforcement or medical
personnel to arrive, to where we received the phone call about
10:30. We looked to see if there .. just a hypothetical
Situation, Your Honor, at 8:30 there’s a text or phone call out
to so and so, or a text message to someone saying my son is no
longer alive. We’re looking for any items along that line.

Os And where is mother currently at this point, or do you
know?

A. She’s with family personnel.

Q. Okay. And how is the phone secured by the Morgan County
Sheriff’s Department?

A. I received it from an evidence technician from Mooresville.
Q. Okay. Now are you aware of whether or not she turned the
phone over voluntarily?

A. She surrendered the phone to Mooresville.

Q. Okay. And since that time, has that .. since the phone has
been returned, was turned over to your possession, have you had

it in your possession the entire time?

A. As far as I know, yes.

Q. Okay. And let’s see

A. Basically, Your Honor, after we do a forensic download of
the phone, the phone will be returned to her. We're just trying
to get any pertinent information on there because the phone
could be erased or factory reset and we'd lose any information
involving the investigation of a suspicious death.

Q. And throughout whenever you have an investigation when you
have a suspicious death or potential suspicious death, this
would be a normal course of your investigation in order to
verify the information that the witnesses or the personnel
involved are being truthful.

A. This is one of the steps we use, yes ma’am.

Q. Okay.

MS. STARNES: I have nothing further, unless
Detective, you have anything else, I have nothing else, Your
Honor.

THE COURT: Okay. The Court will grant the search
warrant request. It’s limited in scope, the phone was turned
over voluntarily by Ms. Price. Based upon the testimony of the
officer, there is probable cause to support the warrant, it’s
narrow in scope. Let’s see. Is there a limitation of date as

to when the search would occur?

MS. STARNES: Judge, I did not put that in the face of
the search warrant. If the Court needs a specific day, I think
the Detective has a request.

DETECTIVE SANDERS: Your Honor, as soon as the Court
grants the search warrant, it’s going to go over to Detective
Chambers from Martinsville. The phone will be forensically
downloaded and be returned back to the mother this evening.

THE COURT: Well what I’m talking about is within the
phone, what you’re searching, the search of the data.

MS. STARNES: The forensic download would be anything
contained on the phone.

DETECTIVE SANDERS: Anything currently on the phone is
my understanding, is the way Detective Chambers explained it to
us, Your Honor.

MS. STARNES: So it would not be a specific date
range, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay.

MS. STARNES: And for the record, the photographs of
the search warrant, or photographs of the phone that we want to
search are on the back of the search warrant.

THE COURT: Okay. All right, we will grant the
request, find it is supported by probable cause, based upon the
testimony of the officer. Anything further?

MS. STARNES: No, Judge.

THE COURT: All right, we’1ll be adjourned.
