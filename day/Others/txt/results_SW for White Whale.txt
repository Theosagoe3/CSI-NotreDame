That is related to an investigation of the offense(s) of:

Possession of Child Pornography, I.C. 35-42-4-4

The reasons and grounds for affiant’s belief that there exists probable cause for
conducting a search and seizure as detailed above are as follows:

I, Eric Tamashasky, am deputized as a Special Deputy with full law enforcement powers
with the St. Joseph County Police Department. I have been a special deputy since 2011 and am
responsible for the St. Joseph County Cybercrimes Against Children Unit. Prior to my role as a
Special Deputy with the St. Joseph County Police Department, I was a deputy prosecuting
attorney for the St. Joseph County Prosecutor’s Office since 2004. In that capacity, I prosecuted

major crimes—including cybercrimes cases. I was the lead prosecutor for the St. Joseph County
Prosecutor’s Office High Tech Crimes Unit from 2007 until is closure in 2009. I have training
on cybercrime investigations from the United States Secret Service, the National Center for
Missing and Exploited Children, the National White Collar Crime Center, and the Internet
Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Taskforce.

I received training specifically related to the online sharing and distribution of child
pornography from the ICAC Task Force that was specifically related to online file sharing via
peer-to-peer clients. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file sharing is the method by which users on the same
network share digital files with one another. I am trained to search for child pornography on
both the Ares Peer to Peer Network (September 2013) and BitTorrent peer-to-peer file sharing
(December 2014).

P2P investigations typically center upon contact with particular IP addresses. An “IP
address” is a numeric address for a particular computer accessing the internet on a particular date
and time. Once online, the IP address is unique to a particular access point. It is possible for
multiple computers to use one public IP address through the use of internal networking. Should
a particular IP address become an address of interest in an investigation, it is reasonable to

believe multiple computers may be using the same IP address.

INVESTIGATORY METHODS

During my training in Ares investigations, I was given a program that allowed me to
search the Ares P2P network for files possibly containing child pornography. We tested and
validated the program during the training class itself to ensure it located appropriate files and
only downloaded from a single source at a time. The program works by comparing the Ares
network’s own listing of user’s files versus a list of files known to law enforcement to be
associated with child pornography. Not every file contained within the law enforcement Ares
database is child pornography in that some of the files depict the child victims of child abuse in
licit states. The existence of a photograph of a known victim of child abuse is relevant because
child pornography collectors may acquire “series” images of victims. A “series” may be a
couple of licit pictures followed by that same child being abused and raped. Files are generally
catalogued on file sharing sites by the hash value of a particular file, not by the file name

attached to the file. “Hash values” are numeric values calculated by the application of a
particular algorithm or formula to a digital data. The formulas that calculate hash values are so
sensitive that a change of one pixel in a picture will completely change the hash value. They are
akin to digital fingerprints. File names are easily changed and altered to disguise the contents of
a file. To change a hash value requires additional knowledge and skill not generally displayed
by P2P traders.

The tool also captures the IP addresses of those individuals offering files of interest for
distribution. The program determines the approximate geographic location of a particular user’s
device by searching publically available tools with the captured IP address information. Because
of this feature, investigators may focus on users offering files for distribution that are located in
particular geographic areas. Our program has been tested and validated to do only single source
downloads; this means that when we attempt to download a file from a user it is only that
particular user who provides the file to us. While the general architectural design of P2P file
sharing is to gather file pieces from multiple users, our search methodology only allows us to
retrieve file pieces from a single user. This ensures we have relevant information about the
file(s) possessed by that singular user.

Once a file of interest has been located on an appropriate geographically located machine,
the Ares tool attempts to download the files. The acquisition of partial files—so long as those
fragments themselves contain verifiable contraband—is not a weakness of this tool. Internet
connections may time out or the user sharing the file could leave the network or move the file.
The reason a partial file I obtain is significant is that it is proof the user possessed the entire file
at one time. Since Ares clients only report hash values to the network once the user possesses
the complete file, the only files our tool can seek to obtain are those files the user’s machine
reported as possessing completely. The partial obtained by the Ares tool represents a sample of
the entire item possessed by the user.

Note that newly manufactured child pornography will not show up in via our Ares
investigatory tool. The only files we attempt to download are those files already known to law
enforcement for their relevance to online child exploitation because they’ ve been obtained
previously. New files have as-of-yet unknown hash values that cannot have been entered into

our database of previously found files of interest.

INVESTIGATORY DETAILS
During my the course of my investigations of Ares, my investigative program identified a
computer with the IP address 23.119.118.36 as a potential download candidate (source) for over
100 file(s) of investigative interest. That IP address geolocates to South Bend, Indiana and
appears to be owned by AT&T Internet Services. I have obtained a complete download of a file
from a computer at 23.119.118.36. I viewed the movie file and I believe that it represents child
pornography as defined by both state of Indiana and federal law. A description of the video
follows:

* On March 4, 2016, my computer began a download from a user at 23.119.118.36.
Specifically, I was connected to 23.119.118.36 from 2016/Mar/04 20:46:08 UTC 05:00
to 2016/Mar/04 21:04:09 UTC 05:00. I obtained a file named “sexo infantil pai filha pai
mete na menina sado anal-parte!.mpg” from a device at that IP address. I viewed the file
and it is 1:15 long. The video shows a child that appears to be younger than 10 years old,
gagged, bent over a table while an adult male inserts his penis into the child. Ultimately,
the adult male ejaculates onto the child’s back. I am not able to determine the gender of
the child due to the camera angle.

The record I have of contacts with 23.119.118.36 dates back to 2013. Over that time, my
machine reported over 181 files of investigatory interest from that IP address. This is the first
time I have successfully initiated a download from that device.

Through my training and experience, I believe that people who search for and view child
pornography generally keep the items they collect. And even if a person deletes the item after
some period of time, a forensic computer examination often can find part (or all) of the deleted
files on the person’s hard drive; it is very difficult to successfully remove all traces of a deleted
file from a hard drive.

On March 7, 2016 a query on the IP address 23.119.118.36 was conducted through the
American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) via whatismyipaddress.com. I received
information that the IP address is registered to AT&T Internet Services. I obtained a subpoena to
AT&T for the subscriber information and service location of that IP address. As a result of that
subpoena, ATT replied that “Gerald Wendt” is responsible for the billing for the IP address. Mr.
Wendt’s billing and service address are the same: 23711 State Road 23, South Bend, Indiana,
46614.
As of May 13, 2016, my investigative program still showed the presence of a computer at
the 23.199.118.36 IP address on the ARES network within the last several days. Detective Phil
Williams, SJCPD, drove by the address and took photographs of the property listed in the ATT
subpoena results. A photograph taken by Detective Williams of 23711 State Road 23, South
Bend, Indiana 46614 is below:

 

I believe that a search warrant for the items detailed above is relevant to provide evidence
of who is utilizing the internet connection at 23711 S.R. 23, South Bend, Indiana to search for
and download digital files containing child pornography. I have learned through my training and
experience that individuals who seek out child pornography on the internet often save those
items once found to remote storage devices, including flash drives, external hard drives, or even

memory cards. Further, even if a user deletes materials after a period of time, I believe that a
forensic examination of the computer equipment can often reveal the presence of deleted files,
even after years of user deletion.
All of the above events occurred within St. Joseph County, Indiana.

1 affirm, under the penalties for perjury that, to the best of my knowledge belief, the

foregoing is true.
