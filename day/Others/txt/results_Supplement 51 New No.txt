CH. 5. THE FOURTH AMENDMENT 51

If so, how short is short enough not to be a search? In Kinslow v. State, 2019
WL 2440229 (Ind. Ct. App. 2019), investigators placed a GPS device inside a
package that Kinslow later picked up and placed in his car. The police tracked
the location of Kinslow’s car as it drove around for about six hours. The Indiana
Court of Appeals held that no search occurred under Carpenter:

While the United States Supreme Court found that tracking such
information violated Carpenter’s expectation of privacy, we read the
Court’s holding to apply to records, such as cellphone tracking data,
that hold for many Americans the ‘privacies of life.” Cell phone
location data provides an intimate window into a person’s life,
revealing not only his particular movements, but through them his
professional, political, religious, and sexual associations. Because the
tracking of Kinslow lasted only approximately six hours and because
the electronic devices used here do not provide an intimate window
into a person’s life, we find that Carpenter has no bearing on this case.

Id. at *3 n.6. See also Sims v. State, 569 S.W.3d 634 (Tex. Ct. Crim. App. 2019)
(holding that Carpenter applies to real-time cell-site pinging, but that
obtaining real-time location with five pings over less than three hours was
insufficient to trigger a Carpenter search).

C. EXCEPTIONS TO THE
WARRANT REQUIREMENT

2. EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES

At the top of page 477, before the beginning of Section 3, add the
following new Notes 5 and 6:

5. When does seizing a computer for too long without a warrant justify
suppression of the evidence found inside it? In United States v. Jobe, 933 F.3d
1074 (9th Cir. 2019), the Ninth Circuit added a wrinkle to the question of how
long an officer can seize a computer before obtaining a warrant to search it.
Even if a computer was seized and held for an overly long period, the court
reasoned, the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule may apply if the
extended period of the warrantless seizure was not particularly culpable and
the officer reasonably believed the seizure was reasonable. In that setting,
there may be no suppression remedy for the failure to obtain a warrant
promptly. Id. at 1079-80.

If Jobe is correct that the good-faith exception can apply in these
circumstances, how much more time should the good-faith exception add to the
period over which a warrantless seizure of a computer is effectively allowed?

6. Exigent circumstances requires reason to believe digital evidence will
be destroyed or concealed. In Hupp v. Cook, 931 F.3d 307 (4th Cir. 2019),
Trooper Cook testified that he had a regular practice of seizing any computer
or cell phone that he believed might contain video of a crime he was
52 THE FOURTH AMENDMENT ne
investigating. He did this, he claimed, because digital evidence can be
deleted or destroyed. The Fourth Circuit concluded that Trooper Cook’s '
practice was not permitted by the exigent circumstances exception:

easily
egular

In an era in which cell phones are increasingly used to capture much
of what happens in daily life, it is important to emphasize the
limitations that the Fourth Amendment continues to place on a
state’s seizure of video evidence.

The exigent circumstances exception does not permit police officers
to do what Trooper Cook routinely does: seize video evidence without
a warrant even when there is no reason to believe that the evidence
will likely be destroyed or concealed. Such a rule would allow officers
to seize as a matter of course video-recording devices from not just
those involved in an incident, but also from neighbors and other
curious bystanders who happen to record the events as they
transpire. Under this view, police officers would lawfully be
permitted to enter the home of every person living nearby who stands
in her doorway or window recording an arrest, to seize her recording
device, and to do so without a warrant or her consent—simply
because video evidence, by its nature, can be easily deleted.

Such a view finds no support in our Fourth Amendment
jurisprudence. While video evidence contained in a cell phone can be
easily deleted or concealed, it is not merely the ease with which
evidence may be destroyed or concealed that dictates exigency. An
officer must also have reason to believe that the evidence will be
destroyed or concealed. In short, adopting the broad definition of
exigency urged by Trooper Cook would remove the exigent
circumstances exception to the warrant requirement from the class
of narrow and well-delineated exceptions permissible under the

Fourth Amendment. It would convert exigency from an exception to
the rule.

Id. at 329-30.
