The reasons and grounds for affiant's belief that there exists probable cause for
conducting a search and scizurc as detailed above are as follows:

1, Eric Tamashasky, am deputized as a Special Deputy with ful! law enforcement powers
with the St. Joseph County Police Department. [ have been a special deputy since 2011 and am
responsible for the St, Joseph County Cybercrimes Against Children Unit, Prior to my role as 3
Special Deputy with the St. Joseph County Police Department, I was a deputy prosecuting
attomey for the St. Joseph County Prosecutor’s Office since 2004. in that capacity, I prosecuted
major crimes—including cybercrimes cases. 1 was the lead prosecutor for the St. Joseph County
Prosccutor’s Office High Tech Crimes Unit from 2007 until is closure in 2009, I have training
on cybercrime investigations from the United States Secret Service (including a two week course
on mobile device forensics and a I week course on online social network investigations), the
National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the National White Collar Came Center,
and the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Taskforce.

The statements in this report are based on my personal knowledge, and on information
that ] have received from other law enforcement personne] and from persons with knowledge
regarding relevant facts of this investigation. 1 have not included each and cvery fact known To
me conceming this investigation.

On June 12, 2017, ] received information from Commander Brian Young of the St.
Joseph County Special Victims Unit that a friend of his, Leanne Tokars, had been receiving
offensive and troubling messages via her public Faccbook page. Commander Young was asking
for direction on this matter as it involved social media and potentially criminal conduct. I
advised Commander Young that I would assist in this investigation. Ms. Tokars had previously
reported conduct involving what she belicvcs to be the same user via different Facebook account
in 2015, Detective Tim Williams from MPD provided copies of their case file to Commander
Young for my review on 6/12/2017, In cach case, the Facebook user sent Ms, Tokars images
that appeared to be “scl fies” and those images appear to show the same person.

On 6/13/2017, I asked Ms. Tokars to provide me with the Facebook User ID and specific
copies of the messages and images sont to her by the Facebook user. Ms. Tokars was able to
provide me with a Facchook user ID of 100011208224380. This 1D represents the origin of the

series of Facebook private messages she received. I reviewed screen captures of the messages
Fram. €ric Tompehenhy = Fax: (574} 490-9303 To. B742450800@Prcfax.con Fax: (674) 245-8800 Page 4 of 7 O6NARO17 2:58 Pe

she was sent. On April 2, 2017, Ms. Tokars received a “selfic’ of an adult male with a message
“Thought 1 drop by and say hi.” Three days later, the user sent another message thal said “1
didnt know you were maricd though.” (Ms. Tokars is not married). On April 20, 2017, Ms.
Tokars recived two messages that stated “Baby Leanne” and “lol I really want fo know what
you think when you read that. Please inform me..” On May 31, 2017, she received two more
messages; “Baby Leanne” and “We're gonna have some fun this weekend.” On Sunday, June
11, 2017, the FB User sent her a picture of herself and then, 16 minutes later, a picture of two
men having sex with one woman. The woman’s hair color and style seem consisient with Ms.
Tokars’. In the image, the males” penises can been seen inserted into the woman's anus and
mouth. Another image of a woman performing oral sex on a man followed, then another picture
of Ms. Tokars (from a CBS Super Bow! promotion), followed by a woman (again with same hair
color) holding two adult penises while her breasts are exposed, Ms. Tokars finally wrote back to
the FB User the single word, “Stop.” The person returned her message by simply stating, “She
speaks @”. The user images sent to Ms. Tokars are consistent with unwanted contact from
another Facebook user in 2016 (Ms. Tokars believes the images show the same person).

This series of messages is unwanted and unwelcome; it scrves no legitimate
communication to send unsolicited pornography to another person. Given the message about
meeting (which Ms. Tokars found disconcerting as she does not know this person), then the
series of pomography images, I believe it is reasonable to believe that the person’s intent is to
cither harass, annoy, or alarm Ms. Tokars. Moreover, the images of sexual activity appeal to the
pruricnt interest in sex, depict in a patently offense way sexual conduct, and lack serious literary,
artistic, political, or scientific valuc, especially given the non-conscnsual way they were
exhibited, These images were distributed using the internet via Facebook.

This search warrant is for Facebook book information to help identify the user sending
these images to Ms. Tokars. The warrant secks both nen-conlent information (c.g. IP logs for
user connections to the account) and content (all messages and images over the time period for
the purpose of attempting to determine the identity of the person(s) in control over the Facebook
account with a user DD 100011208224380.)

Finally, I believe that notice of this investigation will necessarily alert the target
user that law enforcement has begun to take steps to identify them. I believe that any notice of

our interest will result in reasonable individuals taking steps to thwart our investigation including

destroying evidence, taking steps to securely destroy evidence (means of which are available via
a simple google search), applying encryption 1o evidence drives, and otherwise adversely
affecting our ability to effectively determine the identity of the uscr who has transmitted these
images to the victim, I am therefore requesting this Court atso ordor Facebook to refrain from
notifying the account holder before we have the opportunity to identify them to avert any chance
to destroy evidence.

I affirm, under the penalties for perjury that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the

foregoing is trac.
