are being:concealed in the following:
1, Silver Samsung Galaxy S7 phone bearing partial DEC number “089476327” recovered from Kevin
Carter.
2. White Samsung Galaxy S5 phone bearing partial IMEI number “354691” and SKU number
“$234A” recovered from Tiffani Colschen.
The phones are currently secured by Det. Ethan Smith.
Your affiant states that his investigation revealed the following:
On Dec. 14, 2016 at approximately 2330 hours, while traveling east bound on Walnut St., Dep.
Brandon Mattingly observed a black Ford Mustang (lic# D408EN) drive left of center three times. I

initiated a traffic stop at Walnut St. and Vann Ave., Evansville, Indiana. Dep. Mattingly observed the

3
front seat passenger making ‘furtive movements with his hands. It appeared that he was placing an
unknown object underneath his seat.

Dep. Mattingly made contact with the female driver identified as Tiffani Colschen. Colschen
then told Dep. Mattingly she did not have a driver’s license and could not locate the vehicle's
registration or insurance. The passenger, who was identified as Kevin Carter, also indicated he did
not have any identification.

While waiting for an assisting Deputy, a BMV inquiry response indicated Colschen’s license
was suspended. When Deputy Fein arrived, Dep. Mattingly requested Colschen to step out of her
vehicle. Colschen indicated that Carter and her purchased the vehicle three weeks ago and have not
got it registered. Dep. Mattingly then requested to search "her" vehicle, to which she responded "I
dont care, it's his car," referring to Carter. She also said, "If something is in there it’s not mine."

Carter was then requested to step out of the vehicle. During Dep. Mattingly’s interview with
Carter, he-also indicated "they" bought the vehicle three weeks ago. Dep. Mattingly also requested
Carter’s consent to search the vehicle, to which he replied "yeah that’s fine."

After receiving consent, Dep. Mattingly began his search. As he began searching the
passenger's side, he noticed a McDonald’s bag sitting in the console between the driver’s and
passenger's:seat. After he opened the bag, he observed a needle and spoon inside of a sandwich box
which he recognized through his training and experience as associated with the use of illegal narcotics.
Also inside the McDonald’s bag, he observed a large clear plastic bag containing a white crystal
substance that through his training and experience he recognized to. be methamphetamine.

At this point Dep. Mattingly stopped his search and placed both involved subjects in handcuffs,
He then recited Carter his Miranda warning. Carter stated, "I will speak to my lawyer". Dep.
Mattingly then stopped his interview and sat Carter in the back of his patrol car, Colschen was placed

in the back of Deputy Fein's patrol car, while Det. Mattingly recovered the narcotics.

The first baggie recovered field tested positive for Methamphetamine.and had a field weight of
207 grams. The second bag recovered also field tested positive for Methamphetamine and had a field.
weight of 19.83 grams. A third baggie recovered field tested positive for Heroin and had a field weight
of 9 grams. Another bag, recovered also field tested for Heroin and had a field weight of 21 grams.

The last baggie recovered field tested positive for Cocaine and had a field weight 2.36 grams.

During Deputy Fein's interview with Colschen, she indicated she and Carter had been together
since approximately 1500 hours. She also told Dep. Fein that approximately 15 minutes prior to the
car stop they stopped and ordered food from McDonald’s. She also told Dep. Fein that-she didn’t know
the narcotics were in the vehicle. Dep. Fein told me while taking photographs he could feel the warmth
of thé sandwich box that contained the needle and spoon.

All recovered narcotics were placed into evidence. Plus, both Carter and Colschen’s cellphones
were collected and placed into evidence.

Your Affiant knows based on his training and experience that methamphetamine is typically
purchased in one gram quantities. The quantity of meth recovered from Carter and Colschen’s vehicle
is consistent with dealing activity, rather than simply a user amount. Your Affiant also knows based on
his training and experience that heroin is typically purchased by the tenth of a gram. The quantity of
heroin recovered from Carter and Colschen’s vehicle is most certainly consistent with dealing activity,
rather than simply a user amount.

Based on your Affiant’s training and experience, your Affiant knows that individuals who are
involved in the sale and/or purchase of illicit narcotics primarily use cellular telephones, electronic
devices and other data storage devices (including, but not limited to: computers, tablet computers,
thumb drives and memory cards) to communicate with other individuals involved in the purchase:

5
and/or sale of illicit narcotics and/or store information relating to the purchase and/or sale of illicit
narcotics. Individuals who are involved in these acts do not only communicate through actual phone
calls but through the use of text messaging and other applications (such as Facebook, Twitter and other
social media site. applications) to contact. the other individuals involved in the purchase and/or sale of
illicit narcotics. Based on your-affiant’s training and experience, examining phones, electronic devices
and other data storage devices, and contents therein, of an individual involved in the purchase and/or
sale of illicit narcotics often produces leads which are helpful in identifying individuals who deal in
that, or other, illicit substarice(s).

Your affiant speaks from personal knowledge and observation and believes that all persons
named above speak from personal knowledge and observation and are reliable and credible in that they
voluntarily relayed the above. information to either your affiant or wii law enforcement personnel
during the. course of their law enforcement dutiés in an effort to.aid in the investigation of this offense.
Your affiant believes there is a factual basis for the above in that the information given by each of the
individuals is corroborated by that given by the other.

‘WHEREFORE, your affiant believes and has good and probable cause to believe that the
above-described property constituting fruits, instrumentalities and evidence of the aforesaid
crime.of DEALING, POSSESSION and/or CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT DEALING OR
POSSESSION OF METHAMPHETAMINE.

This Affidavit is made for the sole and only purpose. of obtaining a Search Warrant.
