INVESTIGATION:

On Saturday, November 26, 2011, at 12:41 a.m., units from the Fifth District responded
to the 1200 block of Simms PI., NE, to investigate the sound of gunshots. Also, a 911
caller stated two people were shot at the location. The first unit on the scene located
two gunshot victims in the rear of 1261 Simms Place, NE. The first victim was suffering
from a gunshot wound to the upper torso. The second victim was suffering from a
gunshot wound to the arm. DCFEMS responded to the scene and transported both
victims to hospitals. The first victim (hereinafter referred to as “decedent”) was
transported to Medstar. At 0330 hours, the decedent succumbed to his injuries and was
pronounced dead by Dr. Shiflett. His remains were transported to the Office of the
Chief Medical Examiner pending an autopsy. The decedent was subsequently
identified as Mico Briscoe. The second victim was transported to Howard University
Hospital, treated and released.
Case 1:13-cr-00013-ABJ Document 8-3 Filed 02/22/13 Page 3 of 11

The preliminary investigation revealed that the decedent and the second victim were
shot in front of the Circle 7 Express convenience store located at 1211 Mt. Olivet Road,
NE, and they ran to the rear of 1261 Simms Place, NE, where they were located by
officers. The 1200 block of Simms Place, NE, is in the rear of the Circle 7 Express.

During the initial on scene investigation, technicians of the Metropolitan Police
Department Forensic Science Division recovered several expended cartridge casings in
the parking lot of the Circle 7 Express convenience store. Technicians recovered from
the parking lot nineteen (19) 9mm expended cartridge casings, multiple fragments, and
multiple bullets. MPD Firearms Examination Section analyzed the firearms evidence
collected from the scene of the shooting and confirmed the presence of two different
firearms.

On Saturday, November 26, 2012, Dr. Joseph Pestaner of the District of Columbia
Medical Examiner's Office performed an autopsy on the decedent, Mico Briscoe. Dr.
Pestaner advised that the decedent sustained two gunshot wounds. Dr. Pestaner ruled
the cause of death to be gunshot wounds to the body and the manner of death to be a
homicide.

Your affiant along with other detectives interviewed all the surviving victims of the
shooting. There were a total of four surviving victims who were with the decedent at the
time of the shooting. The second victim (referred to above) sustained a gunshot to the
arm, Victim #3 sustained a graze wound to the shoulder, Victim #4 had three (3) bullets
that entered and exited his jacket, none taking effect, and Victim #5 did not sustain any
injuries. The surviving victims provided formal statements and they reported that they
did not know who was responsible for the shooting. The surviving victims reported that
there were no incidents prior to the shooting and that the shooting was unprovoked.
The decedent and the surviving victims were raised in the Trinidad neighborhood;
however, they didn’t claim any crew affiliations.

Your affiant reviewed all the video footage from all the cameras in the area of the
shooting. Footage captured from a combination of cameras around the time of the
shooting revealed a tan/gold four door sedan (hereinafter referred to as “Suspect
Vehicle”) circling the 1200 block of Mt. Olivet Road, NE. The Suspect Vehicle appeared
to be conducting surveillance on the decedent and the surviving victims.

Video footage from a combination of surveillance cameras captures the decedent and
the surviving victims walking through the parking lot of the Northeast Market which is
located at 1201 Mt. Olivet Rd, NE. Two suspects are observed in the distance near the
intersection of Mt. Olivet Rd and West Virginia Ave, NE. The decedent and the surviving
victims do not appear to be aware that the two suspects were in pursuit of them. The
two suspects walk into the parking lot of the Northeast Market and then begin to run in
the direction of the decedent and the surviving victims. Suspect #1 pulls down what
appears to be a mask over his face. Suspect #1 appears to be holding something in his
right hand which your affiant surmises to be a handgun. Suspect #2 is wearing
Case 1:13-cr-00013-ABJ Document 8-3 Filed 02/22/13 Page 4 of 11

something on his head and has dreadlocks past his shoulder. Suspect #2 appears to
be holding something his left hand.

Video footage from the Circle 7 captures the decedent and the surviving victims being
shot at. The suspects are not captured by this footage. Victim #5 is observed entering
the Circle Seven and taking cover. The decedent and three of the surviving victims
(Victims #2-4) are observed ducking then running eastbound on Mt. Olivet Road, NE
and out of sight of the camera.

Video footage from Kovack’s Liquor (which is next door to the Circle 7) captures the
Suspect Vehicle traveling eastbound in the right lane in the 1200 block of Mt. Olivet
Road, NE, and making a right hand turn into the parking lot of Kovack’s Liquor. The
Suspect Vehicle goes to the rear of the parking lot where another camera captures it
making a U-turn. The Suspect Vehicle is observed with a sticker affixed to the driver's
side front windshield which is consistent with the placement of a District of Columbia
Inspection Sticker. Additionally, the Suspect Vehicle is observed with a sticker affixed
to the rear driver’s side vent window. The Suspect Vehicle drives up to the entrance of
the parking lot and stops. The front of the Suspect Vehicle is facing Mt. Olivet Road.
The Suspect Vehicle appears to be waiting for someone. A few seconds later the two
suspects are observed running away from the direction of the shooting to the awaiting
Suspect Vehicle. Suspect #1 enters the front passenger side and Suspect #2 enters
the rear driver's side of the awaiting Suspect Vehicle. The Suspect Vehicle immediately
exits the parking lot onto Mt. Olivet Road, traveling eastbound towards Bladensburg
Road, NE.

During the course of the investigation into this homicide, witnesses were located and
formally interviewed by your affiant and other detectives of the Criminal Investigation
Division, Homicide Branch. One such witness, hereafter referred to as “W-1", advised
that IT was driving westbound in the 1200 block of Mt. Olivet Road, NE, when IT heard
gunshots.

W-1 observed a gold sedan idling in the parking lot of Kovak’s Liquors. W-1 then
observed the two people IT believed to be the shooters running to and entering the
awaiting gold sedan. W-1 stated that the gold sedan made a right hand turn out of the
parking and traveled eastbound on Mt. Olivet Road, NE, in the direction of Bladensburg
Road, NE. W-1 was unable to obtain the tags to the gold sedan.

Members of the Metropolitan Police Department's Intelligence Division reported to your
affiant that the “Trinidad Crew’ has been in an ongoing “beef” (conflict) with members of
the “E Street Bangaz.” Your affiant is aware that the decedent and the surviving victims
are loosely affiliated with the “Trinidad Crew”. The “Trinidad Crew” and “E Street
Bangaz” have an extensive history of assaults with deadly weapons (ADW Gun),
assaults with intent to kill (AWIK), and homicides. According to the Intelligence Division,
the “E Street Bangaz” operate in the 1600 block E Street, Northeast, known as the
Rosedale neighborhood.
Case 1:13-cr-00013-ABJ Document 8-3 Filed 02/22/13 Page 5 of 11

On Saturday, November 26, 2011, Detective James Wilson showed Officer Jeffrey
Scharf a portion of the original video footage of the suspects captured by the Northeast
Market surveillance cameras to ascertain if he could identify the suspects. Upon
viewing the video footage, Officer Scharf identified Suspect #2 in the video as Dwayne
Hilton, aka Wayne-Wayne, aka Wayne. Officer Scharf indicated that he had known
Dwayne Hilton, aka Wayne-Wayne, for approximately eight (8) years. Officer Scharf
identified Dwayne Hilton, aka Wayne-Wayne, aka Wayne from his physical appearance,
hair style (shoulder length dreads), his walk (bow-legged), the way he runs, and his
apparent left handedness. Officer Scharf further reported that he’s watched Hilton
participate in organized sporting events when he was younger and that Hilton is left
handed.

Officer Scharf has worked in the Fifth District his entire career and has knowledge of the
crews operating in the Fifth District specifically the “E Street Bangaz”. Officer Scharf
has known that “E Street Bangaz” and the Trinidad Crew have been and are currently
“beefing” with one another. Additionally, Officer Scharf is aware that Hilton’s crew
affiliation is with the “E Street Bangaz’.

Your affiant presented Officer Scharf with a single color Metropolitan Police Department
identification photograph of Dwayne Hilton, aka Wayne-Wayne, aka Wayne (PDID: ©
612-766) for confirmation purposes. Officer Scharf confirmed that Dwayne Hilton, aka
Wayne-Wayne, is the person depicted in the video footage.

On Thursday, December 22, 2011, your affiant responded to the FBI Forensic Video
and Audio Unit located in Quantico, Virginia, to pick up enhanced video from Kovak’s
Liquor. The FBI determined that the Suspect Vehicle captured by Kovak’s Liquors
cameras is consistent with a 1999-2003 Mitsubishi Galant four door sedan with a moon
roof. The FBI was not able to enhance the footage to determine the tag of the Suspect
Vehicle.

On Sunday, January 29, 2012, First District officers observed a 2001 gold Mitsubishi
Galant with a moon roof with District registration BG4566. The vehicle was parked in
the rear of 448 20th Street, NE. The vehicle was not occupied. A WALES check was
conducted on the District registration BG4566 and it revealed that the registered owner
is Ms. Jesimenia Queen of 448 20" Street, NE. Officers reported that Ms. Queen has a
son named Ezra Griffith-Queen who lives with her at the vehicle's registered address.
Officer Scharf reported that he personally has observed Griffith-Queen driving the 2001
gold Mitsubishi Galant. According to Officer Scharf, Erza Griffith-Queen is a validated
member of “E Street Bangaz” and hangs with fellow crew members Dwayne Hilton and
Carl Oliphant. Ms. Queen is the mother of Ezra Griffith-Queen and Enok Queen.

On Friday, September 7, 2012, your affiant met Ms. Jesimenia Queen at her office.
After being advised of the identity of the interviewing detectives, and the purpose of the
interview, Ms. Queen confirmed that she once owned a gold Mitsubishi Galant with
District tag BG4566, but on June 13, 2012, she donated the Mitsubishi Galant to a
Case 1:13-cr-00013-ABJ Document 8-3 Filed 02/22/13 Page 6 of 11

charity associated with veterans. The vehicle was exclusively operated by her son,
Ezra Griffith-Queen, with a few exceptions when her brother drove it.

Your affiant advised Ms. Queen that we were investigating a shooting that occurred on
November 26, 2011, in the 1200 block of Mt. Olivet Road, Northeast, just after midnight.
Your affiant told Ms. Queen that we had obtained video footage of her vehicle leaving
the area moments after the shooting. She initially stated that her son was incarcerated
at the time of the shooting. She corrected herself and stated that Ezra Griffith-Queen
was arrested in December of 2011 and remained incarcerated. She stated that Griffith-
Queen was incarcerated in Upper Marlboro, Maryland.

Your affiant asked Ms. Queen if she’s aware of any “beefs” or disputes that her son
(Griffith-Queen) may have with anyone. She reported that in 2008 Griffith-Queen was
shot in the neighborhood while playing basketball. She further advised that Griffith-
Queen was shot yet another time in 2009 with his cousins, Carl Oliphant and Dwayne
Hilton while visiting their grandmother, Barbara Cooper, who resides in the 1200 block
of 17" Street, NE.

Your affiant is aware that the 1200 block of 17" Street, NE, is at the intersection of 17"
and Bladensburg Road, NE. The intersection of 17" and Bladensburg Road, NE, is the
eastern boundary of the “Trinidad Crew” which is the rival crew of the “E Street
Bangaz”. She reported that Griffith-Queen was driving the Mitsubishi Galant when
someone shot at all three of them while in the vehicle. They managed to drive back to
her house. Griffith-Queen sustained a graze wound to his hand. She reported that the
Mitsubishi Galant was struck several times by the gunfire.

Your affiant queried I/LEADS for the two alleged shootings which Griffith-Queen was a
victim. The query revealed that Griffith-Queen was shot on two different occasions,
once in September 2008 (where the "Trinidad Crew" was believed to be responsible)
and again in November 2008 (shot in the hand while driving a 2001 Mitsubishi Galant
with Carl Oliphant and Dwayne Hilton). In each case Griffith-Queen refused to
cooperate with investigators and the cases were never adjudicated.

On Thursday, September 13, 2012, a Superior Court for the District of Columbia grand
jury subpoena was issued to the Custodian of Records of the Prince George’s County
Correctional Center compelling them to provide all jail house phone calls and visitor logs
from September 6 through September 13, 2012 relating to Ezra Griffith-Queen.

On Monday, October 1, 2012, the Prince George’s County Correctional Center complied
with the subpoena and provided your affiant a CD containing all of the jail house calls
from September 6 through September 13, 2012, pertaining to Griffith-Queen.

Your affiant reviewed a portion of Griffith-Queen’s jail house calls for September 7",
2012 which correlated with the interview of Ms. Jesimenia Queen. It is your affiant’s
belief that the contents discussed in the conversations between Griffith-Queen and
others are a clear indication that Griffith-Queen was the driver of the Suspect Vehicle on
Case 1:13-cr-00013-ABJ Document 8-3 Filed 02/22/13 Page 7 of 11

the night of the shooting. Below is a brief synopsis of the jail house calls placed by
Griffith-Queen:

Griffith-Queen places a collect call from the Prince George’s County Detention Center to
his home number 202-398-7557. (Ms. Jesimenia Queen provided her home phone
number as 202-398-7557.) An unknown male informs him that two detectives from D.C.
came to the house looking for his (Ezra’s) mother. Griffith-Queen asks “they come
today?” The unknown male confirms that the detectives did come today. Griffith-Queen
response is “mannnn, what the fuck”. After a brief conversation, Griffith-Queen inquires
if the detectives left a card (business card). The unknown male misinterprets the
reference to the business card to a car. It triggers laughter from the unknown male.

The unknown male tells Griffith-Queen that it doesn't relate to the car. Griffith-Queen is
relieved to know that it doesn’t relate to the car.

Griffith-Queen places a collect call from the Prince George’s County Detention Center to
his grandmother's home number, 202-399-2005. His grandmother answers the phone
and tells him that he needs to talk with his mother. His grandmother places a three-way
call to his mother’s work telephone number. His mother proceeds to tell him about two
detectives that came to her house and to her job inquiring about her vehicle (Mitsubishi
Galant). His mother tells him that the detectives have evidence that the Mitsubishi
Galant was captured by surveillance video on November 26, 2011, the day after
Thanksgiving, at the time of a shooting in the Trinidad neighborhood. Griffith-Queen
asks his mother “and what they talking about”. His mother tells him that detectives
inquired about him and others. He asks his mother, “they know it’s your car or they
trying to say it's your car’. She confirms that the police assured her that it’s her car.
Griffith-Queen appears to be concerned and his mother tells him that she will keep him
posted. His mother tells him “you need to think about it, did you do anything? Griffith-
Queen replies “no”. His mother tells him “You better be correct because they have
pictures”. His mother and his grandmother continue to inquire about the incident. His
grandmother is under the impression that he was incarcerated at the time of the
shooting, however Griffith-Queen confirms to them that he was home for Thanksgiving.
The grandmother says that she is very upset with the situation and tells him that she
hopes that he wasn’t captured by surveillance video. His mother hangs up the phone
and he continues to converse with his grandmother.

Griffith-Queen places a collect call from the Prince George's County Detention Center to
his home number, 202-398-7557. A male answered the phone later identified in the
phone call as “Wayne” (believed to be Dwayne Hilton). Griffith-Queen says “man you
know it’s about that”. Your affiant surmises that Griffith-Queen is referring about the
shooting of the decedent. Hilton replies to Griffith-Queen, “nah ahh” (slang for “no way”)
in disbelief. Hilton again replies “nah ahh”. Griffith-Queen assures him that he’s telling
the truth and he states “man, on Scooby”. Your affiant knows Michael Jenkins, aka
Scooby, to be a victim of a homicide in 2006 in the District of Columbia and a close
friend to Griffith-Queen and Hilton. Hilton asks “what they say, you?” Griffith-Queen
replies “nah they talking about uhh” and there is a pause. Hilton says “the whip” (slang
for a car). Griffith-Queen replies “yeah”. Griffith-Queen tells Hilton that the police have
photographs of the car tags. Hilton attempts to reassure Griffith-Queen that the police
do not have photographs of the tags, but rather the car. Hilton changes the
conversation. Your affiant surmises that Hilton knows that jail calls are recorded and
they avoid any further incriminating statements.

Griffith-Queen asks Hilton to place a three-way call to Griffith-Queen’s child’s mother.
She answers the phone and she hears another male’s voice. She asks Griffith-Queen
“who's that?” and he replies “Wayne” (Hilton). Griffith-Queen tells her “man this shit is
crazy man” and she asks “what's wrong?” Griffith-Queen replies “the shit” and he
proceeds to tell her that the police have photographs of the tags. She asks “what car,
the Mitsubishi?” Griffith-Queen replies “yeah”. She replies “oh wow, she going to cut all
our asses off” (referring to Griffith-Queen’s mother). Griffith-Queen replies “but | want to
know man, man, man” then he catches himself and he changes the conversation.
Griffith-Queen does not deny any involvement in the shooting to Hilton or to his child’s
mother. Your affiant surmises that Griffith-Queen does not deny involvement in the
shooting because Hilton is one of the shooters and his child’s mother has knowledge
about the incident.

Griffith-Queen places a collect call from the Prince George's County Detention Center to
his grandmother's home number, 202-399-2005. He tells his grandmother to place a
three-way call to his little brother. His grandmother places a three-way call to his
younger brother. A male answers the phone and says, “hello”. He says “Enok” and the
person replies “yeah”. Your affiant knows that Enok Queen is the younger sibling of
Griffith-Queen. He asks “where’s mommy at?” Enok tells him that she is right next to
him, he asks “what they talking about?” He wants to know when his mother is going to
the precinct to talk to the detectives. He asks his brother if he accompanied their
mother to the police station. They have a brief conversation about local high school
football. He then asks “where’s Wayne at?” Enok confirms that he and Wayne were in
the house together in the earlier call. Enok informs him that Carl (believed to be Carl
Case 1:13-cr-00013-ABJ Document 8-3 Filed 02/22/13 Page 9 of 11

Oliphant) wants to talk to Griffith-Queen. Enok tells him that Carl does not have a
phone and that he’s currently walking to Carl’s house. He tells Enok “that shit crazy
man”. Enok replies “what? yeah, that situation?” He says “yeah man”. Enok says
“that’s what | was saying too, I’m like, that’s, | mean that’s the word, it's crazy”. Enok
says, “yeah, they ain’t got shit”. He replies “I know man, that’s shit’. Enok says, “that’s
what I’m saying”. Enok then says, “what the fuck, | was thinking about, if | would have
thought that, you know, you would have been, you know”. He replies “exactly, exactly”.
Enok then states, “someone have to be saying something.” In this passage, your
affiant believes that Griffith-Queen and Enok Queen are under the impression that if law
enforcement had evidence they (Griffith-Queen and others) would have already been
charged with the shooting. Thus it must be someone cooperating with law enforcement.
Griffith-Queen tells Enok, “they looking at what happen in 2008 with my hand.” Your
affiant knows that Griffith-Queen was a victim of a shooting in 2008. Griffith-Queen tells
Enok “there’s no detainer or warrant in the system.” It is your affiant’s belief that Griffith-
Queen is concerned that law enforcement may lodge a detainer for his arrest in
reference to the shooting of the decedent. Enok tells Griffith-Queen that he is walking
inside Carl’s house.

Enok hands the phone to Carl Oliphant. Griffith-Queen and Carl exchange Muslim
greetings. He and Carl have a brief conversation about high school football and
neighborhood friends. He asks Carl “I know you heard about that shit, detectives came
to the house earlier, Enok can tell you.” Carl asks “about you?” and he replies “No,
about the car”. They change the conversation to something else.

Enok hands the phone to Car! Oliphant. Griffith-Queen and Oliphant exchange Muslim
greetings. Griffith-Queen and Oliphant have a brief conversation about high school
football and neighborhood friends. Griffith-Queen asks Oliphant “I know you heard
about that shit, detectives came to the house earlier, Enok can tell you.” Oliphant asks
“about you?” and Griffith-Queen replies, “No, about the car”. They change the
conversation to something else.

On Monday, October 1, 2012, your affiant located the current registered owner
(hereinafter referred as W-2) of the 2001 Mitsubishi Galant once owned by Ms. Queen
and driven by Griffith-Queen. W-2 brought the vehicle to the Homicide Branch to be
inspected and photographed by investigators. Your affiant questioned W-2 about the
condition of the vehicle. W-2 reported that IT had not made any changes to the vehicle
since IT purchased it. The Mitsubishi Galant is the same color (gold) as described by
W-1, has a moon roof, has a sticker affixed to the driver's side front windshield, and
has a similar sticker affixed to the rear driver’s side vent window as the Suspect Vehicle
awaiting Hilton and the second unknown shooter. It is your affiant’s belief, that the
Suspect Vehicle and the Mitsubishi Galant once owned by Ms. Queen and driven by
Griffith-Queen is one in the same.

On several of the jail house calls, Griffith-Queen mentions “Sheree”. Griffith-Queen
mentions to his mother that Sheree’s mother is in the hospital and in a coma.
Case 1:13-cr-00013-ABJ Document 8-3 Filed 02/22/13 Page 10 of 11

Griffith-Queen was released from Maryland Department of Corrections on September
27, 2012, after serving approximately 10 months. Since his release, your affiant has
made several attempts to locate and interview Griffith-Queen. Your affiant has
interviewed his mother (Jesimenia Queen), brother (Enok Queen), grandmother
(Barbara Cooper), and relatives about a possible address or phone number for Griffith-
Queen. Every single individual has reported that they don’t know where he resides and
they have no way to contact him. It's abundantly evident that his family did not want to
disclose Griffith-Queen’s home address to law enforcement.

On Thursday, November 15, 2012, | requested for Griffith-Queen’s visitor logs while
housed at Prince George's County Detention Center in Upper Marlboro, Maryland.
Department of Corrections queried Griffith-Queen’s visitor logs. The query revealed
that Griffith-Queen only had a single visitor for his entire incarceration. The visitor is
only identified as “Sheree Lewis.”

Your affiant queried Columbo for Sheree Lewis. The queried revealed a Sheree
Romaine Lewis, B/F, DOB: 9-14-1990, SSN: 579-21-9659, PDID: 652-301, of 1512
Tobias Drive, Southeast, Washington, D.C.

A third witness was interviewed, hereinafter referred as W-3. W-3 reported that Sheree
Lewis lives at 2638 Birney Place #302, Southeast, Washington, D.C. with her boyfriend
“Ezra” LNU. According to W-3, Ezra was recently released from jail after serving a
sentence. Your affiant presented W-3 with a single color Metropolitan Police
Department identification photograph of Ezra Griffith-Queen for confirmation purposes.
W-3 confirmed that the individual depicted in the photograph is the person IT knows at
Ezra who lives at 2638 Birney Place #302, Southeast, Washington, D.C. with Sheree
Lewis.

On Wednesday, November 28, 2012, Detective James Wilson queried Accurint for
Sheree Lewis and Griffith-Queen. Accurint is an investigative tool utilized by law
enforcement for the identification of people and their assets, addresses, relatives and
business associates by providing access to a database of public records. The Accurint
check verified that Sheree Lewis and Griffith-Queen both have provided their address
as 2638 Birney Place #302, Southeast, Washington, D.C.,

Additionally, your affiant has knowledge that Ms. Sheree Lewis (plaintiff) filed a petition
(Docket: 12DRB3319) for custody of a child before Superior Court for the District of
Columbia Family Court. Ms. Lewis provided her home address on the petition as 2638
Birney Place #302, Southeast, Washington, D.C.

Based upon your affiant’s professional training and experience and your affiant’s work
with other veteran police officers and detectives, | know that gang/crew members
involved in criminal activity maintain regular contact with each other, even when they
are arrested or incarcerated, and that they often stay advised and share intelligence
about their activities through cell phones and other electronic communication devices
and the Internet, to include Facebook, Twitter and E-mail accounts.

Based upon the aforementioned facts and circumstances, and your affiant’s experience
and training, there is probable cause to believe that secreted inside of 2638 Birney
Place #302, Southeast, Washington, D.C., is evidence relating to the homicide
discussed above. Your affiant respectfully requests that a District of Columbia Superior
Court Search Warrant be issued for the entire premises of 2638 Birney Place, #302,
Southeast, Washington, D.C., allowing the seizure of all electronic devices to include
but not limited to cellular telephone(s), computer(s), electronic tablet(s), devices capable
of storing digital images (to include, but not limited to, PDAs, CDs, DVD's jump/zip
drives), evidence of ownership of such devices, subscriber information relating to the
electronic devices, any information describing, referencing, or mentioning in anyway the
above-described offense, any handwritten form (such as writing to include but not
limited to notes, papers, or mail matter), photographs, newspaper articles relating to the
shooting death of Mico Briscoe, and any indicia of occupancy of the premises described
above.

INVESTIGATION:

On Saturday, November 26, 2011, at 12:41 a.m., units from the Fifth District responded
to the 1200 block of Simms PI., NE, to investigate the sound of gunshots. Also, a 911
caller stated two people were shot at the location. The first unit on the scene located
two gunshot victims in the rear of 1261 Simms Place, NE. The first victim was suffering
from a gunshot wound to the upper torso. The second victim was suffering from a
gunshot wound to the arm. DCFEMS responded to the scene and transported both
victims to hospitals. The first victim (hereinafter referred to as “decedent”) was
transported to Medstar. At 0330 hours, the decedent succumbed to his injuries and was
pronounced dead by Dr. Shiflett. His remains were transported to the Office of the
Chief Medical Examiner pending an autopsy. The decedent was subsequently
identified as Mico Briscoe. The second victim was transported to Howard University
Hospital, treated and released.
Case 1:13-cr-00013-ABJ Document 8-3 Filed 02/22/13 Page 3 of 11

The preliminary investigation revealed that the decedent and the second victim were
shot in front of the Circle 7 Express convenience store located at 1211 Mt. Olivet Road,
NE, and they ran to the rear of 1261 Simms Place, NE, where they were located by
officers. The 1200 block of Simms Place, NE, is in the rear of the Circle 7 Express.

During the initial on scene investigation, technicians of the Metropolitan Police
Department Forensic Science Division recovered several expended cartridge casings in
the parking lot of the Circle 7 Express convenience store. Technicians recovered from
the parking lot nineteen (19) 9mm expended cartridge casings, multiple fragments, and
multiple bullets. MPD Firearms Examination Section analyzed the firearms evidence
collected from the scene of the shooting and confirmed the presence of two different
firearms.

On Saturday, November 26, 2012, Dr. Joseph Pestaner of the District of Columbia
Medical Examiner's Office performed an autopsy on the decedent, Mico Briscoe. Dr.
Pestaner advised that the decedent sustained two gunshot wounds. Dr. Pestaner ruled
the cause of death to be gunshot wounds to the body and the manner of death to be a
homicide.

Your affiant along with other detectives interviewed all the surviving victims of the
shooting. There were a total of four surviving victims who were with the decedent at the
time of the shooting. The second victim (referred to above) sustained a gunshot to the
arm, Victim #3 sustained a graze wound to the shoulder, Victim #4 had three (3) bullets
that entered and exited his jacket, none taking effect, and Victim #5 did not sustain any
injuries. The surviving victims provided formal statements and they reported that they
did not know who was responsible for the shooting. The surviving victims reported that
there were no incidents prior to the shooting and that the shooting was unprovoked.
The decedent and the surviving victims were raised in the Trinidad neighborhood;
however, they didn’t claim any crew affiliations.

Your affiant reviewed all the video footage from all the cameras in the area of the
shooting. Footage captured from a combination of cameras around the time of the
shooting revealed a tan/gold four door sedan (hereinafter referred to as “Suspect
Vehicle”) circling the 1200 block of Mt. Olivet Road, NE. The Suspect Vehicle appeared
to be conducting surveillance on the decedent and the surviving victims.

Video footage from a combination of surveillance cameras captures the decedent and
the surviving victims walking through the parking lot of the Northeast Market which is
located at 1201 Mt. Olivet Rd, NE. Two suspects are observed in the distance near the
intersection of Mt. Olivet Rd and West Virginia Ave, NE. The decedent and the surviving
victims do not appear to be aware that the two suspects were in pursuit of them. The
two suspects walk into the parking lot of the Northeast Market and then begin to run in
the direction of the decedent and the surviving victims. Suspect #1 pulls down what
appears to be a mask over his face. Suspect #1 appears to be holding something in his
right hand which your affiant surmises to be a handgun. Suspect #2 is wearing
Case 1:13-cr-00013-ABJ Document 8-3 Filed 02/22/13 Page 4 of 11

something on his head and has dreadlocks past his shoulder. Suspect #2 appears to
be holding something his left hand.

Video footage from the Circle 7 captures the decedent and the surviving victims being
shot at. The suspects are not captured by this footage. Victim #5 is observed entering
the Circle Seven and taking cover. The decedent and three of the surviving victims
(Victims #2-4) are observed ducking then running eastbound on Mt. Olivet Road, NE
and out of sight of the camera.

Video footage from Kovack’s Liquor (which is next door to the Circle 7) captures the
Suspect Vehicle traveling eastbound in the right lane in the 1200 block of Mt. Olivet
Road, NE, and making a right hand turn into the parking lot of Kovack’s Liquor. The
Suspect Vehicle goes to the rear of the parking lot where another camera captures it
making a U-turn. The Suspect Vehicle is observed with a sticker affixed to the driver's
side front windshield which is consistent with the placement of a District of Columbia
Inspection Sticker. Additionally, the Suspect Vehicle is observed with a sticker affixed
to the rear driver’s side vent window. The Suspect Vehicle drives up to the entrance of
the parking lot and stops. The front of the Suspect Vehicle is facing Mt. Olivet Road.
The Suspect Vehicle appears to be waiting for someone. A few seconds later the two
suspects are observed running away from the direction of the shooting to the awaiting
Suspect Vehicle. Suspect #1 enters the front passenger side and Suspect #2 enters
the rear driver's side of the awaiting Suspect Vehicle. The Suspect Vehicle immediately
exits the parking lot onto Mt. Olivet Road, traveling eastbound towards Bladensburg
Road, NE.

During the course of the investigation into this homicide, witnesses were located and
formally interviewed by your affiant and other detectives of the Criminal Investigation
Division, Homicide Branch. One such witness, hereafter referred to as “W-1", advised
that IT was driving westbound in the 1200 block of Mt. Olivet Road, NE, when IT heard
gunshots.

W-1 observed a gold sedan idling in the parking lot of Kovak’s Liquors. W-1 then
observed the two people IT believed to be the shooters running to and entering the
awaiting gold sedan. W-1 stated that the gold sedan made a right hand turn out of the
parking and traveled eastbound on Mt. Olivet Road, NE, in the direction of Bladensburg
Road, NE. W-1 was unable to obtain the tags to the gold sedan.

Members of the Metropolitan Police Department's Intelligence Division reported to your
affiant that the “Trinidad Crew’ has been in an ongoing “beef” (conflict) with members of
the “E Street Bangaz.” Your affiant is aware that the decedent and the surviving victims
are loosely affiliated with the “Trinidad Crew”. The “Trinidad Crew” and “E Street
Bangaz” have an extensive history of assaults with deadly weapons (ADW Gun),
assaults with intent to kill (AWIK), and homicides. According to the Intelligence Division,
the “E Street Bangaz” operate in the 1600 block E Street, Northeast, known as the
Rosedale neighborhood.
Case 1:13-cr-00013-ABJ Document 8-3 Filed 02/22/13 Page 5 of 11

On Saturday, November 26, 2011, Detective James Wilson showed Officer Jeffrey
Scharf a portion of the original video footage of the suspects captured by the Northeast
Market surveillance cameras to ascertain if he could identify the suspects. Upon
viewing the video footage, Officer Scharf identified Suspect #2 in the video as Dwayne
Hilton, aka Wayne-Wayne, aka Wayne. Officer Scharf indicated that he had known
Dwayne Hilton, aka Wayne-Wayne, for approximately eight (8) years. Officer Scharf
identified Dwayne Hilton, aka Wayne-Wayne, aka Wayne from his physical appearance,
hair style (shoulder length dreads), his walk (bow-legged), the way he runs, and his
apparent left handedness. Officer Scharf further reported that he’s watched Hilton
participate in organized sporting events when he was younger and that Hilton is left
handed.

Officer Scharf has worked in the Fifth District his entire career and has knowledge of the
crews operating in the Fifth District specifically the “E Street Bangaz”. Officer Scharf
has known that “E Street Bangaz” and the Trinidad Crew have been and are currently
“beefing” with one another. Additionally, Officer Scharf is aware that Hilton’s crew
affiliation is with the “E Street Bangaz’.

Your affiant presented Officer Scharf with a single color Metropolitan Police Department
identification photograph of Dwayne Hilton, aka Wayne-Wayne, aka Wayne (PDID: ©
612-766) for confirmation purposes. Officer Scharf confirmed that Dwayne Hilton, aka
Wayne-Wayne, is the person depicted in the video footage.

On Thursday, December 22, 2011, your affiant responded to the FBI Forensic Video
and Audio Unit located in Quantico, Virginia, to pick up enhanced video from Kovak’s
Liquor. The FBI determined that the Suspect Vehicle captured by Kovak’s Liquors
cameras is consistent with a 1999-2003 Mitsubishi Galant four door sedan with a moon
roof. The FBI was not able to enhance the footage to determine the tag of the Suspect
Vehicle.

On Sunday, January 29, 2012, First District officers observed a 2001 gold Mitsubishi
Galant with a moon roof with District registration BG4566. The vehicle was parked in
the rear of 448 20th Street, NE. The vehicle was not occupied. A WALES check was
conducted on the District registration BG4566 and it revealed that the registered owner
is Ms. Jesimenia Queen of 448 20" Street, NE. Officers reported that Ms. Queen has a
son named Ezra Griffith-Queen who lives with her at the vehicle's registered address.
Officer Scharf reported that he personally has observed Griffith-Queen driving the 2001
gold Mitsubishi Galant. According to Officer Scharf, Erza Griffith-Queen is a validated
member of “E Street Bangaz” and hangs with fellow crew members Dwayne Hilton and
Carl Oliphant. Ms. Queen is the mother of Ezra Griffith-Queen and Enok Queen.

On Friday, September 7, 2012, your affiant met Ms. Jesimenia Queen at her office.
After being advised of the identity of the interviewing detectives, and the purpose of the
interview, Ms. Queen confirmed that she once owned a gold Mitsubishi Galant with
District tag BG4566, but on June 13, 2012, she donated the Mitsubishi Galant to a
Case 1:13-cr-00013-ABJ Document 8-3 Filed 02/22/13 Page 6 of 11

charity associated with veterans. The vehicle was exclusively operated by her son,
Ezra Griffith-Queen, with a few exceptions when her brother drove it.

Your affiant advised Ms. Queen that we were investigating a shooting that occurred on
November 26, 2011, in the 1200 block of Mt. Olivet Road, Northeast, just after midnight.
Your affiant told Ms. Queen that we had obtained video footage of her vehicle leaving
the area moments after the shooting. She initially stated that her son was incarcerated
at the time of the shooting. She corrected herself and stated that Ezra Griffith-Queen
was arrested in December of 2011 and remained incarcerated. She stated that Griffith-
Queen was incarcerated in Upper Marlboro, Maryland.

Your affiant asked Ms. Queen if she’s aware of any “beefs” or disputes that her son
(Griffith-Queen) may have with anyone. She reported that in 2008 Griffith-Queen was
shot in the neighborhood while playing basketball. She further advised that Griffith-
Queen was shot yet another time in 2009 with his cousins, Carl Oliphant and Dwayne
Hilton while visiting their grandmother, Barbara Cooper, who resides in the 1200 block
of 17" Street, NE.

Your affiant is aware that the 1200 block of 17" Street, NE, is at the intersection of 17"
and Bladensburg Road, NE. The intersection of 17" and Bladensburg Road, NE, is the
eastern boundary of the “Trinidad Crew” which is the rival crew of the “E Street
Bangaz”. She reported that Griffith-Queen was driving the Mitsubishi Galant when
someone shot at all three of them while in the vehicle. They managed to drive back to
her house. Griffith-Queen sustained a graze wound to his hand. She reported that the
Mitsubishi Galant was struck several times by the gunfire.

Your affiant queried I/LEADS for the two alleged shootings which Griffith-Queen was a
victim. The query revealed that Griffith-Queen was shot on two different occasions,
once in September 2008 (where the "Trinidad Crew" was believed to be responsible)
and again in November 2008 (shot in the hand while driving a 2001 Mitsubishi Galant
with Carl Oliphant and Dwayne Hilton). In each case Griffith-Queen refused to
cooperate with investigators and the cases were never adjudicated.

On Thursday, September 13, 2012, a Superior Court for the District of Columbia grand
jury subpoena was issued to the Custodian of Records of the Prince George’s County
Correctional Center compelling them to provide all jail house phone calls and visitor logs
from September 6 through September 13, 2012 relating to Ezra Griffith-Queen.

On Monday, October 1, 2012, the Prince George’s County Correctional Center complied
with the subpoena and provided your affiant a CD containing all of the jail house calls
from September 6 through September 13, 2012, pertaining to Griffith-Queen.

Your affiant reviewed a portion of Griffith-Queen’s jail house calls for September 7",
2012 which correlated with the interview of Ms. Jesimenia Queen. It is your affiant’s
belief that the contents discussed in the conversations between Griffith-Queen and
others are a clear indication that Griffith-Queen was the driver of the Suspect Vehicle on
Case 1:13-cr-00013-ABJ Document 8-3 Filed 02/22/13 Page 7 of 11

the night of the shooting. Below is a brief synopsis of the jail house calls placed by
Griffith-Queen:

Griffith-Queen places a collect call from the Prince George’s County Detention Center to
his home number 202-398-7557. (Ms. Jesimenia Queen provided her home phone
number as 202-398-7557.) An unknown male informs him that two detectives from D.C.
came to the house looking for his (Ezra’s) mother. Griffith-Queen asks “they come
today?” The unknown male confirms that the detectives did come today. Griffith-Queen
response is “mannnn, what the fuck”. After a brief conversation, Griffith-Queen inquires
if the detectives left a card (business card). The unknown male misinterprets the
reference to the business card to a car. It triggers laughter from the unknown male.

The unknown male tells Griffith-Queen that it doesn't relate to the car. Griffith-Queen is
relieved to know that it doesn’t relate to the car.

Griffith-Queen places a collect call from the Prince George’s County Detention Center to
his grandmother's home number, 202-399-2005. His grandmother answers the phone
and tells him that he needs to talk with his mother. His grandmother places a three-way
call to his mother’s work telephone number. His mother proceeds to tell him about two
detectives that came to her house and to her job inquiring about her vehicle (Mitsubishi
Galant). His mother tells him that the detectives have evidence that the Mitsubishi
Galant was captured by surveillance video on November 26, 2011, the day after
Thanksgiving, at the time of a shooting in the Trinidad neighborhood. Griffith-Queen
asks his mother “and what they talking about”. His mother tells him that detectives
inquired about him and others. He asks his mother, “they know it’s your car or they
trying to say it's your car’. She confirms that the police assured her that it’s her car.
Griffith-Queen appears to be concerned and his mother tells him that she will keep him
posted. His mother tells him “you need to think about it, did you do anything? Griffith-
Queen replies “no”. His mother tells him “You better be correct because they have
pictures”. His mother and his grandmother continue to inquire about the incident. His
grandmother is under the impression that he was incarcerated at the time of the
shooting, however Griffith-Queen confirms to them that he was home for Thanksgiving.
The grandmother says that she is very upset with the situation and tells him that she
hopes that he wasn’t captured by surveillance video. His mother hangs up the phone
and he continues to converse with his grandmother.

Griffith-Queen places a collect call from the Prince George's County Detention Center to
his home number, 202-398-7557. A male answered the phone later identified in the
phone call as “Wayne” (believed to be Dwayne Hilton). Griffith-Queen says “man you
know it’s about that”. Your affiant surmises that Griffith-Queen is referring about the
shooting of the decedent. Hilton replies to Griffith-Queen, “nah ahh” (slang for “no way”)
in disbelief. Hilton again replies “nah ahh”. Griffith-Queen assures him that he’s telling
the truth and he states “man, on Scooby”. Your affiant knows Michael Jenkins, aka
Scooby, to be a victim of a homicide in 2006 in the District of Columbia and a close
friend to Griffith-Queen and Hilton. Hilton asks “what they say, you?” Griffith-Queen
replies “nah they talking about uhh” and there is a pause. Hilton says “the whip” (slang
for a car). Griffith-Queen replies “yeah”. Griffith-Queen tells Hilton that the police have
photographs of the car tags. Hilton attempts to reassure Griffith-Queen that the police
do not have photographs of the tags, but rather the car. Hilton changes the
conversation. Your affiant surmises that Hilton knows that jail calls are recorded and
they avoid any further incriminating statements.

Griffith-Queen asks Hilton to place a three-way call to Griffith-Queen’s child’s mother.
She answers the phone and she hears another male’s voice. She asks Griffith-Queen
“who's that?” and he replies “Wayne” (Hilton). Griffith-Queen tells her “man this shit is
crazy man” and she asks “what's wrong?” Griffith-Queen replies “the shit” and he
proceeds to tell her that the police have photographs of the tags. She asks “what car,
the Mitsubishi?” Griffith-Queen replies “yeah”. She replies “oh wow, she going to cut all
our asses off” (referring to Griffith-Queen’s mother). Griffith-Queen replies “but | want to
know man, man, man” then he catches himself and he changes the conversation.
Griffith-Queen does not deny any involvement in the shooting to Hilton or to his child’s
mother. Your affiant surmises that Griffith-Queen does not deny involvement in the
shooting because Hilton is one of the shooters and his child’s mother has knowledge
about the incident.

Griffith-Queen places a collect call from the Prince George's County Detention Center to
his grandmother's home number, 202-399-2005. He tells his grandmother to place a
three-way call to his little brother. His grandmother places a three-way call to his
younger brother. A male answers the phone and says, “hello”. He says “Enok” and the
person replies “yeah”. Your affiant knows that Enok Queen is the younger sibling of
Griffith-Queen. He asks “where’s mommy at?” Enok tells him that she is right next to
him, he asks “what they talking about?” He wants to know when his mother is going to
the precinct to talk to the detectives. He asks his brother if he accompanied their
mother to the police station. They have a brief conversation about local high school
football. He then asks “where’s Wayne at?” Enok confirms that he and Wayne were in
the house together in the earlier call. Enok informs him that Carl (believed to be Carl
Case 1:13-cr-00013-ABJ Document 8-3 Filed 02/22/13 Page 9 of 11

Oliphant) wants to talk to Griffith-Queen. Enok tells him that Carl does not have a
phone and that he’s currently walking to Carl’s house. He tells Enok “that shit crazy
man”. Enok replies “what? yeah, that situation?” He says “yeah man”. Enok says
“that’s what | was saying too, I’m like, that’s, | mean that’s the word, it's crazy”. Enok
says, “yeah, they ain’t got shit”. He replies “I know man, that’s shit’. Enok says, “that’s
what I’m saying”. Enok then says, “what the fuck, | was thinking about, if | would have
thought that, you know, you would have been, you know”. He replies “exactly, exactly”.
Enok then states, “someone have to be saying something.” In this passage, your
affiant believes that Griffith-Queen and Enok Queen are under the impression that if law
enforcement had evidence they (Griffith-Queen and others) would have already been
charged with the shooting. Thus it must be someone cooperating with law enforcement.
Griffith-Queen tells Enok, “they looking at what happen in 2008 with my hand.” Your
affiant knows that Griffith-Queen was a victim of a shooting in 2008. Griffith-Queen tells
Enok “there’s no detainer or warrant in the system.” It is your affiant’s belief that Griffith-
Queen is concerned that law enforcement may lodge a detainer for his arrest in
reference to the shooting of the decedent. Enok tells Griffith-Queen that he is walking
inside Carl’s house.

Enok hands the phone to Carl Oliphant. Griffith-Queen and Carl exchange Muslim
greetings. He and Carl have a brief conversation about high school football and
neighborhood friends. He asks Carl “I know you heard about that shit, detectives came
to the house earlier, Enok can tell you.” Carl asks “about you?” and he replies “No,
about the car”. They change the conversation to something else.

Enok hands the phone to Car! Oliphant. Griffith-Queen and Oliphant exchange Muslim
greetings. Griffith-Queen and Oliphant have a brief conversation about high school
football and neighborhood friends. Griffith-Queen asks Oliphant “I know you heard
about that shit, detectives came to the house earlier, Enok can tell you.” Oliphant asks
“about you?” and Griffith-Queen replies, “No, about the car”. They change the
conversation to something else.

On Monday, October 1, 2012, your affiant located the current registered owner
(hereinafter referred as W-2) of the 2001 Mitsubishi Galant once owned by Ms. Queen
and driven by Griffith-Queen. W-2 brought the vehicle to the Homicide Branch to be
inspected and photographed by investigators. Your affiant questioned W-2 about the
condition of the vehicle. W-2 reported that IT had not made any changes to the vehicle
since IT purchased it. The Mitsubishi Galant is the same color (gold) as described by
W-1, has a moon roof, has a sticker affixed to the driver's side front windshield, and
has a similar sticker affixed to the rear driver’s side vent window as the Suspect Vehicle
awaiting Hilton and the second unknown shooter. It is your affiant’s belief, that the
Suspect Vehicle and the Mitsubishi Galant once owned by Ms. Queen and driven by
Griffith-Queen is one in the same.

On several of the jail house calls, Griffith-Queen mentions “Sheree”. Griffith-Queen
mentions to his mother that Sheree’s mother is in the hospital and in a coma.

Griffith-Queen was released from Maryland Department of Corrections on September
27, 2012, after serving approximately 10 months. Since his release, your affiant has
made several attempts to locate and interview Griffith-Queen. Your affiant has
interviewed his mother (Jesimenia Queen), brother (Enok Queen), grandmother
(Barbara Cooper), and relatives about a possible address or phone number for Griffith-
Queen. Every single individual has reported that they don’t know where he resides and
they have no way to contact him. It's abundantly evident that his family did not want to
disclose Griffith-Queen’s home address to law enforcement.

On Thursday, November 15, 2012, | requested for Griffith-Queen’s visitor logs while
housed at Prince George's County Detention Center in Upper Marlboro, Maryland.
Department of Corrections queried Griffith-Queen’s visitor logs. The query revealed
that Griffith-Queen only had a single visitor for his entire incarceration. The visitor is
only identified as “Sheree Lewis.”

Your affiant queried Columbo for Sheree Lewis. The queried revealed a Sheree
Romaine Lewis, B/F, DOB: 9-14-1990, SSN: 579-21-9659, PDID: 652-301, of 1512
Tobias Drive, Southeast, Washington, D.C.

A third witness was interviewed, hereinafter referred as W-3. W-3 reported that Sheree
Lewis lives at 2638 Birney Place #302, Southeast, Washington, D.C. with her boyfriend
“Ezra” LNU. According to W-3, Ezra was recently released from jail after serving a
sentence. Your affiant presented W-3 with a single color Metropolitan Police
Department identification photograph of Ezra Griffith-Queen for confirmation purposes.
W-3 confirmed that the individual depicted in the photograph is the person IT knows at
Ezra who lives at 2638 Birney Place #302, Southeast, Washington, D.C. with Sheree
Lewis.

On Wednesday, November 28, 2012, Detective James Wilson queried Accurint for
Sheree Lewis and Griffith-Queen. Accurint is an investigative tool utilized by law
enforcement for the identification of people and their assets, addresses, relatives and
business associates by providing access to a database of public records. The Accurint
check verified that Sheree Lewis and Griffith-Queen both have provided their address
as 2638 Birney Place #302, Southeast, Washington, D.C.,

Additionally, your affiant has knowledge that Ms. Sheree Lewis (plaintiff) filed a petition
(Docket: 12DRB3319) for custody of a child before Superior Court for the District of
Columbia Family Court. Ms. Lewis provided her home address on the petition as 2638
Birney Place #302, Southeast, Washington, D.C.

Based upon your affiant’s professional training and experience and your affiant’s work
with other veteran police officers and detectives, | know that gang/crew members
involved in criminal activity maintain regular contact with each other, even when they
are arrested or incarcerated, and that they often stay advised and share intelligence
about their activities through cell phones and other electronic communication devices
and the Internet, to include Facebook, Twitter and E-mail accounts.
Case 1:13-cr-00013-ABJ Document 8-3 Filed 02/22/13 Page 11 of 11

Based upon the aforementioned facts and circumstances, and your affiant’s experience
and training, there is probable cause to believe that secreted inside of 2638 Birney
Place #302, Southeast, Washington, D.C., is evidence relating to the homicide
discussed above. Your affiant respectfully requests that a District of Columbia Superior
Court Search Warrant be issued for the entire premises of 2638 Birney Place, #302,
Southeast, Washington, D.C., allowing the seizure of all electronic devices to include
but not limited to cellular telephone(s), computer(s), electronic tablet(s), devices capable
