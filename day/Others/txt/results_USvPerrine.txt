[518 F.3d 1199]

Kristen B. Patty, Wichita, Kansas (Philip R. White, Ariagno, Kerns, Mank & White, LLC,
Wichita, Kansas, with her on the brief) for Defendant-Appellant.

Brent |. Anderson, Assistant United States Attorney, Wichita, Kansas (Eric F. Melgren,
United States Attorney, Wichita, Kansas, with him on the brief) for Plaintiff-Appellee.

Before TACHA, ANDERSON, and GORSUCH,, Circuit Judges.
ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.

Defendant and appellant Steven C. Perrine appeals the denial of his motion to suppress
evidence following his conviction by a jury on three counts relating to the distribution, receipt
and/or possession of child pornography, one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted
felon, and two counts of criminal forfeiture. He also appeals the denial of his motion to dismiss
the case against him, on the ground that governmental authorities engaged in outrageous
conduct. We affirm.

BACKGROUND

On September 2, 2005, James Vanlandingham reported to local police that, while ina
Yahoo! chat room and while using the screen name "dana_hotlipsO5," he began chatting with a
person with the screen name "stevedragonslayer." “stevedragonslayer" invited
Vanlandingham/"dana_hotlips05" to watch a web cam video depicting two nude six-to-nine-year-
old girls. While waiting for the police to arrive, Vanlandingham stayed on the line with
“stevedragonslayer" and continued to chat. Vanlandingham asked if "stevedragonslayer" had
any more videos, to which "stevedragonslayer" replied he did not know what might offend
“dana_hotlips05." After Vanlandingham informed "“stevedragonslayer" that he liked "the young
hard stuff," “stevedragonslayer" played several videos depicting young girls in various explicit
sexual acts.

“stevedragonslayer" stopped sending video clips to "dana_hotlipsO5" prior to the arrival of
police officers at Vanlandingham's house, but Vanlandingham was able to preserve a copy of the
chat room conversation. One of the Pennsylvania law enforcement authorities interviewed
Vanlandingham and viewed the saved chat room conversation.

Based upon Vanlandingham's account of these events, Pennsylvania law enforcement
personnel obtained a disclosure order dated October 14, 2005, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d)
and 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 5743(d), + directing Yahoo! to provide the subscriber information for the
screen name "stevedragonslayer." Yahoo!'s records indicated that "stevedragonslayer" logged
on to the Yahoo! website from the IP address 68.103.177.146 on October 9, 2005, October 22,
2005, October 29, 2005, October 30, 2005, November 1, 2005, and November 6, 2005. 2

Further investigation revealed that this IP address was maintained by Cox Communications,
Inc. Pennsylvania authorities obtained another disclosure order requiring Cox to provide the
subscriber information for that IP address. Cox reported that the Yahoo! logins from this particular
IP address at the times reported by Yahoo!

[518 F.3d 1200]

were associated with an account belonging to Steve Perrine, 11944 Rolling Hills Court, Wichita,
Kansas.

Pennsylvania authorities then contacted Kansas authorities, who discovered that Steve
Perrine had a prior state conviction for sexual exploitation of a child, for which he was still on
probation. Wichita police obtained a search warrant for Perrine's house, which was executed on
December 22, 2005. In addition to seizing Perrine's computer, the police also found firearms and
drug paraphernalia. They accordingly amended the search warrant to authorize seizure of those
items as well. A forensic examination of Perrine's computer revealed thousands of images of
child pornography.

On February 7, 2006, Perrine was charged in a superceding indictment with one count of
distributing child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(2); one count of receiving child
pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(2); one count of possessing child pornography,
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(4)(B); one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in
violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2); and two counts of forfeiture. Among other
motions, Perrine filed a motion to suppress and a motion to dismiss based upon outrageous
government conduct.

The district court held a motions hearing, at which Perrine testified that he was
“stevedragonslayer." Perrine further testified that he had enabled peer-to-peer file sharing on his
computer, thereby giving anyone with internet access and certain software the ability to gain
entrance to certain files on his computer. After subsequent briefing, the district court denied
Perrine's motions.

The case proceeded to a jury trial. A Wichita Police Department Computer Forensics
detective, Detective Stone, testified that he found in excess of 16,000 images of child
pornography on Perrine's computer. Detective Stone also found Kazaa, a peer-to-peer file
sharing program, installed on Perrine's computer. Stone further testified that Kazaa is a program
which allows individual users like Perrine to identify folders that are available to share with
others, search other computers with Kazaa for specific topics, and download files from other
computers, while allowing other computers to download files from Perrine's computer. 2

Additionally, Annie Cheung, the senior compliance paralegal at Yahoo!, testified that Yahoo!
tracks dates, times, and IP addresses for log-in attempts on a Yahoo! account and maintains that
information for approximately thirty days. She further

[518 F.3d 1201]

testified that Yahoo! records showed that the IP addresses 68.103.177.226 and 68.103.177.146
belonged to "stevedragonslayer."

Perla Rodriguez, the Cox Communications Customer Escalations Coordinator, testified that
residential account IP addresses can change because they are leased for twenty-four hours ata
time. Cox Communications residential account IP addresses release and renew every twenty-
four hours; when an IP address releases, if the same IP address is available, it reattaches within
a few seconds. Rodriguez further testified that only one IP address is assigned to a user at a time
and that it is the customer's address on the internet when he or she is online. She stated that the
IP address 68.103.177.146 was used by Perrine. Perrine was convicted on all counts.

Perrine thereafter filed a motion for a new trial, a motion for a judgment of acquittal, anda
motion for arrest of judgment. After denying the motions, the district court sentenced Perrine to
235 months' imprisonment, to be followed by supervised release for life. Perrine appeals, arguing
(1) the district court erred in failing to suppress evidence obtained against him in violation of the
Fourth Amendment and/or 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d) and 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 5743(d); and (2) the district
court erred in failing to dismiss the case against Perrine due to outrageous government conduct.

DISCUSSION

Perrine appeals the denial of his motion to suppress. "When reviewing a district court's
denial of a motion to suppress, we review the district court's factual findings for clear error and
consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government." United States v. Zamudio-
Carrillo, 499 F.3d 1206 , 1209 (10th Cir. 2007). Further, “[dJeterminations relating to the
sufficiency of a search warrant and the applicability of the good-faith exception are conclusions of
law, ... which this court reviews de novo." United States v. Danhauer, 229 F.3d 1002 , 1005
(10th Cir.2000). Finally, while we review the district court's ruling on the sufficiency of a search
warrant de novo, we do not review de novo the determination of probable cause by the issuing
judge or magistrate. Rather, a state judge's “decision to issue a warrant is entitled to great
deference," and we "need only ask whether, under the totality of the circumstances presented in
the affidavit, the [state] judge had a ‘substantial basis' for determining that probable cause
existed." United States v. Artez, 389 F.3d 1106 , 1111 (10th Cir.2004) (further quotations and
citations omitted).

 

 

We first consider Perrine's argument that evidence was seized in violation of the ECPA and
its state law equivalent, as well as the Fourth Amendment.

|. ECPA/State Law and Fourth Amendment

Perrine argues that compliance with 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d) and 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 5743(d) is
“akin to a Terry stop within the scope of the Fourth Amendment and suppression is available to
remedy violations." Appellant's Br. at 7. Section 2703 is the core provision of the ECPA, and it
authorizes the government to require disclosure of stored communications and transaction
records by third-party service providers. Under 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c)(2), "[a] provider of electronic
communication service or remote computing service shall disclose to a governmental entity the . .
.name;... address; .. . telephone or instrument number or other subscriber number or identity,
including any temporarily assigned network address . . . of a subscriber to or customer of such
service. .. ." 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c)(2). Section 2703(d) specifies that "[a] court order for disclosure

[518 F.3d 1202]

under subsection . . . (c) .. . shall issue only if the governmental entity offers specific and
articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the . . . records or
other information sought[ ] are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation." 18
U.S.C. § 2703(d). 4

Perrine argues that suppression, an appropriate remedy for an impermissible Terry stop, ° is
an available remedy for a violation of the ECPA. However, section 2708 of the ECPA specifically
states that [t]he remedies and sanctions described in this chapter are the only judicial remedies
and sanctions for nonconstitutional violations of this chapter." 18 U.S.C. § 2708. Section 2707, in
turn, describes remedies for violations of the Act as including civil actions for violators other than
the United States and administrative discipline against federal employees in certain
circumstances. 18 U.S.C. § 2707. Thus, violations of the ECPA do not warrant exclusion of
evidence. See United States v. Steiger, 318 F.3d 1039 , 1049 (11th Cir. 2003); United States v.
Smith, 155 F.3d 1051 , 1056 (9th Cir.1998); Bansal v. Russ, 513 E.Supp.2d 264 , 282-83
(E.D.Pa.2007); United States v. Sherr, 400 F.Supp.2d 843 , 848 (D.Md.2005); United States v.

Kennedy, 81 F.Supp.2d 1103 , 1110 (D.Kan.2000). ®

 

Perrine next argues that, in any event, the government violated the ECPA and the
Pennsylvania law by failing to present "specific and articulable" facts in support of its
applications for court orders requiring Yahoo! and Cox to reveal Perrine's IP address and name,
and that the government therefore used illegally obtained information in support of its search
warrants. We disagree. As Perrine notes, the "specific and articulable facts" standard derives
from the Supreme Court's decision in Terry. Thus, we are familiar with the standard imposed.

Perrine argues the government's affidavit in support of its application for an order failed to
provide specific and articulable facts because it did not attach a copy of the "chat" between
“stevedragonslayer" and Vanlandingham;; it did not contain anything specifically indicating that
Vanlandingham was a truthful and reliable person; and it failed to show that “stevedragonslayer"
was logged on to Yahoo! on the date of the crime, September 2, 2005, at 2 p.m. The affidavit
attached to the October 14, 2005, application for a disclosure order for Yahoo! stated as follows:

Officer Humbert received information from Leetsdale Police Officer Wayne Drish indicating
that a resident of his jurisdiction had received what appeared to be child pornography via his
computer while in a Yahoo! Inc messaging chat room.

Officer Humbert interviewed the resident, James Vanlandingham, and learned that he was
logged into Yahoo Messaging Chat on September 2, 2005 at approximately 2:00 PM EDT. He
received a message from an individual logged in Yahoo Messaging Chat as
“stevedragonslayer." This individual invited James Vanlandingham to view his web cam. When
James Vanlandingham viewed the cam he was presented with images of a young female he
describes as between 6 and 9 years of age performing

[518 F.3d 1203]

oral sex on an adult male, images of a young female he describes as between 6 and 9 years of
age having oral sex performed on her by an adult female and images of two young females he
describes as between 6 and 9 years of age walking around in a bathroom unclothed. James
Vanlandingham immediately reported the incident to law enforcement. | did view that chat log of
this session between James Vanlandingham and "“stevedragonslayer."

Appellant's App. at 72, attach. D. The affidavit attached to the December 8, 2005, application
for a disclosure order for Cox recited the same information as above, and added at the bottom:

On 11/22/05 | received a response from Yahoo! Inc. which provided the IP login address of
68.103.177.146 for the screenname "stevedragonslayer" on 10/09/05, 10/22/05, 10/29/05,
10/30/05, 11/01/05, and 11/06/05.

Appellant's App. at 83: attach. E.

The statutory standard requires that "the governmental entity offers specific and articulable
facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the . . . records or other
information sought, are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation." 18 U.S.C. §
2703(d). The affidavits above satisfy that standard. There is no reason to doubt Vanlandingham's
account of what happened; indeed, he immediately contacted the police, which suggests he was
simply a concerned citizen. Further, the officer stated that he had personally read the chat log
between Vanlandingham and "stevedragonslayer." The details provided are specific and
certainly would lead to a reasonable suspicion that "stevedragonslayer" was involved in child
pornography.

Perrine also alleges that the application for the order was deficient because it failed to show
that “stevedragonslayer" was on line with Vanlandingham on September 2, 2005, at 2 PM. The
district court dismissed this as "of no moment" because Yahoo!'s logs simply did not go back that
far. As indicated above, Yahoo! employee Annie Cheung testified that Yahoo! tracks dates,
times, and IP addresses for login attempts on a Yahoo! account and maintains that information for
approximately thirty days. Both Cheung's testimony and the actual document turned over by
Yahoo! to law enforcement pursuant to the court's order revealed that "“stevedragonslayer" had IP
addresses of both 68.103.177.226 and 68.103.177.146. Appellant's App. at 129-30. Yahoo!'s
records also revealed that “stevedragonslayer' with IP address 68.103.177.146 had logged on to
Yahoo! a number of times in October and November 2005.

We agree with the district court that the absence of a specific record of "stevedragonslayer"
with IP address 68.103.177.226 or 68.103.177.146 being logged on at 2 PM on September 2,
2005, does not undermine the adequacy of the affidavit. The reason for that absence is simply
that Yahoo! fails to maintain records for more than thirty days. Perrine admitted he was
“stevedragonslayer" and gives no explanation for who else could have been logged on to Yahoo!
on September 2, 2005, with the name "stevedragonslayer," when every other login for
“stevedragonslayer" matches the IP address of Perrine's computer. ” In sum, we conclude that
the affidavits

[518 F.3d 1204]

submitted in the application for an order under the ECPA and the Pennsylvania statute contained
“specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the . . .
information sought ][ ][is] relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation." 18 U.S.C. §
2703(d); 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 5743(d).

Perrine also appears to make a broader Fourth Amendment challenge to the government's
acquisition of his subscriber information from Yahoo! and Cox. The district court held:

the identifying information at issue here — defendant's name, address, etc. — was
information that he voluntarily transmitted to the third-party internet providers, Cox and Yahoo!.
Indeed, defendant also admitted at the hearing that he had enabled peer-to-peer file sharing on
his computer, thereby giving anyone with internet access the ability to gain entrance to his
computer. Under such a scenario, a defendant holds no reasonable expectation of privacy that
the Fourth Amendment will protect.

Mem. and Order at 16, Appellant's App. at 149. We agree with the district court.

Every federal court to address this issue has held that subscriber information provided to an
internet provider is not protected by the Fourth Amendment's privacy expectation. See, e.g.,
Guest v. Leis, 255 F.3d 325 , 336 (6th Cir.2001) (holding, in a non-criminal context, that
“computer users do not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in their subscriber information
because they have conveyed it to another person-the system operator"); United States v.
Hambrick, 225 F.3d 656 (4th Cir.2000) (unpublished), affirming_United States v. Hambrick, 55
F.Supp.2d 504 , 508-09 (W.D.Va.1999) (holding that there was no legitimate expectation of
privacy in noncontent customer information provided to an internet service provider by one of its
customers); United States v. D'Andrea, 497 F.Supp.2d 117 , 120 (D.Mass.2007) (‘The Smith line
of cases has led federal courts to uniformly conclude that internet users have no reasonable
expectation of privacy in their subscriber information, the length of their stored files, and other
noncontent data to which service providers must have access."); Freedman v. America Online
Inc., 412 F.Supp.2d 174 , 181 (D.Conn.2005) ("In the cases in which the issue has been
considered, courts have universally found that, for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, a
subscriber does not maintain a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to his subscriber
information."); United States v. Sherr, 400 F.Supp.2d 843 , 848 (D.Md.2005) ("The courts that
have already addressed this issue .. . uniformly have found that individuals have no Fourth
Amendment privacy interest in subscriber information given to an ISP."); United States v. Cox.
190 F.Supp.2d 330 , 332 (N.D.N.Y.2002) (Same); United States v. Kennedy, 81 F.Supp.2d 1103 ,
1110 (D.Kan.2000) ("Defendant's constitutional rights were not violated when [internet provider]
divulged his subscriber information to the government. Defendant has not demonstrated an
objectively reasonable legitimate expectation of privacy in his subscriber information."). Cf.
United States v. Forrester, 512 F.3d 500 , 510 (9th Cir.2008) ("e-mail and Internet users have no
expectation of privacy in the to/from addresses of their messages or the IP addresses of the
websites they visit because they should know that this information is provided to and used by
Internet
[518 F.3d 1205]

service providers for the specific purpose of directing the routing of information."); United States
v. Lifshitz, 369 F.3d 173 , 190 (2d Cir.2004) (“Individuals generally possess a reasonable
expectation of privacy in their home computers. ... They may not, however, enjoy such an
expectation of privacy in transmissions over the Internet or e-mail that have already arrived at the
recipient.").

 

Furthermore, as Perrine conceded, he had peer-to-peer software on his computer, which
permitted anyone else on the internet to access at least certain folders in his computer. To the
extent such access could expose his subscriber information to outsiders, that additionally vitiates
any expectation of privacy he might have in his computer and its contents. Thus, Perrine has no
Fourth Amendment privacy expectation in the subscriber information he gave to Yahoo! and Cox.

ll. Search of His House

Perrine also challenges the search of his house. In particular, he argues "[t]he affidavits in
support of the search warrants do not establish probable cause as the facts revealed therein
were not particularized as to [Perrine], contained stale information of alleged criminal activity
relating to [Perrine], and materially omitted facts vitiating probable cause." Appellant's Br. at 22.

"[P]robable cause exists where attending circumstances ‘would lead a prudent person to
believe there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found ina
particular place.""_United States v. Cantu, 405 F.3d 1173 , 1176 (10th Cir.2005) (quoting_United
States v. Basham, 268 F.3d 1199 , 1203 (10th Cir.2001)). In assessing whether there is probable
cause for a warrant, "we assess the sufficiency of a supporting affidavit based on the totality of
the circumstances." /d. Further, a magistrate's or judge's determination that a warrant is
supported by probable cause is entitled to "great deference." /d. On review, our task is to
“ensurfe] that the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding probable cause existed."
United States v. Tisdale, 248 F.3d 964 , 970 (10th Cir.2001) (quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S.
Reports 213 , 238-39, 103 S.Ct. 2317 , 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983) ).

 

 

 

 

The affidavits in support of the search warrants in this case provided sufficient information for
the judge to conclude that probable cause existed. They recited essentially the same facts as in
the applications for the disclosure orders, quoted above, with the addition of a description of the
information obtained from Yahoo! and Cox, which identified Perrine as "stevedragonslayer."
They also recited the fact that Wichita police officer Shawn Bostick, after further investigation of
Perrine/"stevedragonslayer," discovered that he had been previously convicted in Kansas state
court of exploitation of a child, was still on probation for that offense, and that the prior case
involved Perrine sending images of child pornography and showing videos containing child
pornography via Yahoo! Messenger using a web cam.

Perrine argues they were not "particularized to" him, Appellant's Br. at 22, because they did
not state that Yahoo!'s records showed that "stevedragonslayer" was in fact logged on to Yahoo!
on September 2, 2005. For the same reasons we found that this omission did not undermine the
sufficiency of the applications for the disclosure orders, we find it does not undermine the
sufficiency of the affidavits in support of the search warrants.

Perrine next argues that the affidavits contained stale information. Perrine asserts that 111
days had passed between the chat between "stevedragonslayer" and Vanlandingham and the
submission of the affidavits. Whether information is stale depends on "the nature of

[518 F.3d 1206]

the criminal activity, the length of the activity, and the nature of the property to be seized." United
States v. Riccardi, 405 F.3d 852 , 860 (10th Cir.2005) (further quotation omitted). We have
explained:
The observation that images of child pornography are likely to be hoarded by persons
interested in those materials in the privacy of their homes is supported by common sense and the
cases. Since the materials are illegal to distribute and possess, initial collection is difficult.
Having succeeded in obtaining images, collectors are unlikely to destroy them. Because of their
illegality and the imprimatur of severe social stigma such images carry, collectors will want to
secret them in secure places, like a private residence. This proposition is not novel in either state
or federal court: pedophiles, preferential child molesters, and child pornography collectors
maintain their materials for significant periods of time.

Id. at 861 (quoting United States v. Lamb, 945 F.Supp. 441 , 460 (N.D.N.Y.1996)); see also
United States v. Hay, 231 F.3d 630 , 636 (9th Cir.2000); United States v. Harvey, 2 F.3d 1318 ,
1322-23 (3d Cir.1993); United States v. Koelling, 992 F.2d 817 , 823 (8th Cir.1993); United
States v. Rabe, 848 F.2d 994 , 997 (9th Cir.1988). The district court correctly found that the
information in the affidavits was not stale.

 

 

Finally, Perrine argues the affidavits omitted information that would have vitiated probable
cause. Essentially, he reiterates the argument that the affidavits did not state that none of the log
ons by the IP address connected to "stevedragonslayer" occurred on September 2, nor did they
attach the Yahoo! Login Tracker, which revealed that fact. He argues that the judge, had he
known those facts, would not have found probable cause. For the reasons already stated, we
reject this argument. The affidavits gave the issuing judge a “substantial basis for . . . conclud[ing]
that a search would uncover evidence of wrongdoing." Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. Reports 213 ,
236, 103 S.Ct. 2317 , 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Even were we to conclude that probable cause was not established, we would affirm the
denial of Perrine's motion to suppress under the good faith exception of United States v. Leon
468 U. S. Reports 897 , 920-24, 104 S.Ct. 3405 , 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984) . In Leon, “the Supreme
Court adopted a good-faith exception to the application of the exclusionary rule and specifically
applied that exception where ‘an officer acting with objective good faith has obtained a search
warrant from a judge or magistrate and acted within its scope,’ even though the search warrant
was later deemed to be invalid." United States v. Herrera, 444 F.3d 1238 , 1249 (10th Cir. 2006)
(quoting Leon, 468 U. S. Reports 920 , 104 S.Ct. 3405 ). "In this circuit, we have concluded that
‘Leon's good faith exception applies only narrowly, and ordinarily only when an officer relies, in
an objectively reasonable manner, on a mistake made by someone other than the officer."
United States v. Cos, 498 F.3d 1115 , 1132 (10th Cir.2007) (quoting Herrera, 444 F.3d at 1249 ).

 

 

In this case, law enforcement personnel searched Perrine's house in reliance on warrants
issued by a state judge. "When reviewing the reasonableness of an officer's reliance upon a
search warrant, this court must examine the underlying documents to determine whether they are
‘devoid of factual support."" Danhauer, 229 F.3d at 1006 (quoting_United States v. McKneely, 6
F.3d 1447 , 1454 (10th Cir. 1993)). The Leon Court recognized four situations in which an officer
would not have reasonable grounds for believing that a search warrant had been properly
issued. In any of those situations, the good-faith

[518 F.3d 1207]

exception to the exclusionary rule does not apply. Thus, if the issuing judge was misled by an
affidavit containing false information or information that the affiant would have known was false
but for his "reckless disregard of the truth," the evidence should be suppressed. Leon, 468 U. S.
Reports 923 , 104 S.Ct. 3405 . Or suppression is required when the affidavit supporting the
warrant is "so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence
entirely unreasonable." /d. (further quotation omitted). Additionally, the exception does not apply
“when a warrant is so facially deficient that the executing officer could not reasonably believe it
was valid." Danhauer, 229 F.3d at 1007 (citing Leon, 468 U. S. Reports 923 , 104 S.Ct. 3405 ).
None of those situations is present in this case.

 

lll. Governmental Outrageous Conduct
Perrine moved to dismiss this case on the ground that the government had engaged in
outrageous conduct. The district court denied the motion. We review that denial de novo. United
States v. Pedraza, 27 F.3d 1515 , 1521 (10th Cir.1994).

 

Perrine's claim of outrageous governmental conduct is based upon the following: as
indicated above, when Perrine committed the instant offense, he was on probation for a prior
offense involving child pornography on his computer. His computer had been confiscated in
connection with that prior offense. Before the police returned his computer to him, they thought
the computer had been "cleaned" so that all pornography was removed. Wichita Police Detective
Shawn Bostick testified that he had turned the computer over to the forensics unit to have it
cleaned. Prior to releasing the computer to Perrine's attorney in the prior case, Bostick did not
check to see that the forensics unit had in fact cleaned the computer. Perrine claims that the
computer was returned to him with the child pornography from the prior case still on it, which he
claims is tantamount to sticking a needle with heroin into the arm of an addict.

When explaining what happened to Perrine's computer, Bostick testified that, during the
investigation of the prior case, Perrine had mentioned that he kept a hidden back-up copy of each
of his files. Bostick further opined that, if the hidden back-up copy was missed during the search
of the computer, the files could have been moved back to the computer after the computer was
returned to Perrine, and it would appear that the files had been on the computer the entire time.
Bostick thus testified, "As | stated, is it possible | returned child pornography to [Perrine]
mistakenly? It is possible. Is it possible the stuff wasn't there? It's possible." Appellee's
Supp.App. at 49. The district court found "returning these images to defendant was probably
negligent, even incompetent; however, defendant has failed to make any showing that any
governmental official acted intentionally in leaving the images on his computer." Mem. and Order
at 10, Appellant's App. at 143.

“(T]he relevant inquiry when assessing claims of outrageous government conduct is
whether, considering the totality of the circumstances . . . the government's conduct is so
shocking, outrageous and intolerable that it offends the universal sense of justice." United States
v. Garcia, 411 F.3d 1173 , 1181 (10th Cir.2005) (further quotation omitted). "“To succeed on an
outrageous conduct defense, the defendant must show either (1) excessive government
involvement in the creation of the crime, or (2) significant governmental coercion to induce the
crime." Id. (quoting Pedraza, 27 F.3d at 1521 ). An outrageous conduct defense is of "narrow
scope." /d.

 

[518 F.3d 1208]

(quoting_United States v. Lacey, 86 F.3d 956 , 964 (10th Cir.1996)).

 

We agree with the district court that, assuming the government did return Perrine's computer
to him with child pornography still on it, that was the product of negligence or incompetence, at
most. It hardly meets the high standard of outrageous conduct.

CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, the district court's order is AFFIRMED.

Notes:

1. As discussed more fully below, 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d) is part of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act
("ECPA"), which regulates the disclosure of electronic communications and subscriber information. 18 Pa. C.S.A. §
5743(d) is the Pennsylvania state law similar to the ECPA.

2. "The IP, or Internet Protocol, address is unique to a specific computer. Only one computer would be assigned a
particular IP address." United States v. Kennedy, 81 F.Supp.2d 1103 , 1105 n. 3 (D.Kan.2000).
3. Another court has recently described Kazaa as follows:

Kazaa is a computer program that connects a computer to other computers on which the Kazaa program is also
running. Kazaa's purpose is to allow users to download each other's shared files. The Kazaa program allows the user
to designate which folders — and therefore which files — on his computer are shared with other Kazaa users. Each
shared file has several descriptive fields that are viewable by other Kazaa users. These fields generally describe the
file's contents and can be edited by a file's possessor. Kazaa makes each user's shared files discoverable to other
users by allowing any user to perform a keyword search of the descriptive fields of all shared files. Files with
descriptive fields containing the search term are listed for the searcher, who can then see all the descriptive fields for
each file on the list. Based on these descriptions, the searcher decides which of the available files to download onto
his computer. The searcher is likewise free to refrain from downloading a file in which, based on its descriptive fields,
the searcher is uninterested.

 

United States v. Sewell, 513 F.3d 820 , 821 (8th Cir.2008). See also United States v. Shaffer, 472 F.3d 1219 ,
1220-22 (10th Cir.2007) (describing more fully how Kazaa operates).

 

4. 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 5743 provides for comparable disclosure and has virtually identical requirements for the court order.

5. Under_Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. Reports 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868 , 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968) , investigatory stops are
permitted if “supported by a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity." United States v. Treto-Haro, 287 F.3d 1000 ,
1004 (10th Cir.2002).

6. The Pennsylvania statute at issue similarly provides exclusively civil remedies for violations of the act. See 18
Pa.C.S.A. 8§ 5747, 5748.

7. While no one argues the point, and it is not critical to our decision, it is widely known that any single service
provider, like Yahoo!, does not permit more than one subscriber to have the same screen name. Thus, there would
have been only one "stevedragonslayer" as a Yahoo! subscriber during the period of time relevant to this case. Since
Perrine admitted he was "stevedragonslayer" and both Vanlandingham and Officer Humbert observed the chat
session with "stevedragonslayer," there can be little doubt that the individual chatting with Vanlandingham on
September 2, 2005, and showing pornographic videos was, in fact, Perrine. Furthermore, despite his wholly
speculative arguments to the contrary, Perrine presents no evidence that anyone else "hijacked" his computer and
went on line using the name "stevedragonslayer."
