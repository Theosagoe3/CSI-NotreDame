AFFIDAVIT OF INVESTIGATOR

1, Eric Tamashasky, am deputized as a Special Deputy with full law enforcement powers
with the S1. Joseph County Police Department. I have been a special deputy since 2071 and am
responsible for the St. Joseph County Cybercrimes Against Children Unit. Prior to my role as a
Special Deputy with the St. Joseph County Police Department, I was a deputy prosecuting
attorney for the S1. Joseph County Prosecutor's Office since 2004. In that capacity, I prosecuted
major crimes-—including cybercrimes cases. | was the lead prosecutor for the St. Joseph County
Prosecutor's Office High Tech Crimes Unit from 2007 until is closure in 2009. I have training
on cybercrime investigations from the United States Seeret Service, the National Center for
Missing and Exploited Children, the National White Collar Crime Center, and the Internet
Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Taskforce.

lreceived training specifically related to the online sharing and distribution of child
pomography from the ICAC Task Force that was specifically related to online file sharing via
peer-to-peer clients. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file sharing is the method by which users on the same
network share digital files with one another. | am trained lo search for child pornography on
both the Ares Peer to Peer Network (September 2013), BitTorrent peer-to-peer file sharing
(December 2014) and the eMule/eDonkey network (May 2016). L have been conducting P2P
investigations since September 2013.

P2P investigations typically centcr upon contact with particular JP addresses. An “IP
address” is a numeric address for 2 particular computer accessing the internet on a particular date
and time. Once online, the EP address is unique to a particular access point. It is possible for
multiple computcrs to usc one public IP address through the use of intcrnal networking. Should
a particular JP address become an address of interest in an investigation, it is reasonable to

believe multiple computers may be using the same IP address,

INVESTIGATORY MetHops

During my training in Ares investigations, I was given a program thal allowed me to
search the Ares P2P network for files possibly containing child pomography. We tested and
validated the program during the training class itself to ensure it located appropriate files and
only downloaded from a single source ala time, The program works by comparing the Ares
network’s own listing of uscr’s files versus a list of files known to law enforcement to be
associated with child pornography. Not every file contained within the law enforcement Ares
database is child pornography im that some of the files depict the child victims of child abuse in
licit states, The existence of a photograph of a known victim of child abuse is relevant because
child pornography collectors may acquire “scrics” images of victims. A “scries” may be a
couple of licit pictures followed by that same child being abused and raped. Files are generally
catalogued on file sharing sites by the hash value of a particular file, not by the file name
attached to the file, “Hash values” are numcric values calculated by the application of
particular algorithm or formuls to a digital data. The formulas that calculate hash values are so
sensitive thal a change of one pixel in 2 picture will completely change the hash valuc. They arc
akin to digital fingerprints. File names are easily changed and altcred to disguise the contents of
a file. To change a hash value requires additional knowledge and skill not generally displayed
by P2P traders.

The tool also captures the IP addresses of those individuals offering files of interest for
distribution. The program determines the approximate geographic location of a particular uscr’s
device by searching publically available tools with the captured IP address information. Because
of this feature, investigators may focus on users offering files for distribulion that are located in
particular geographic areas. Our program has been tested and validated to do only single source
downloads; this means that when we attempt to download a file from a user it is only that
particular user who provides the file tous. While the general architectural design of P2P file
sharing is to gather file pieces from multiple users, our search methodology only allows us to
retrieve file picccs from a single user, This ensures we have relevant information about the
file(s) possessed by that smgular user.

Once a file of interest has been located on an appropriate geographically located machine,
the Ares tool altempts to download the files. The acquisition of partial files—so long as those
fragments themselves contain verifiable contraband—is not a weakness of this tool, Internet

connections may time out or the user sharing the file could leave the network or move the file.
From. Eric Tammuhexhy Fax. (874) 898-0503 Ta. Fan: (574) 235-6007 Pegs 6 of 8 O52S2017 3:00 Pm

The reason a partial file I obtain is significant is that it is proof the user possessed the entire file
atone time. Since Ares clients only report hash vaiues to the network once the user possesses
the complete file, the only filcs our tool can seck 10 obtain are those files the user’s machine
reported as possessing completely, The partial obtaincd by the Ares tool represents a sample of
the entire item possessed by the user.

Note that newly manufactured child pornography will not show up in via our Arcs
investigatory tool. The only files we attempt to download are those files already known to law
enforcement for their relevance 10 online child exploitation because they‘ve been obtained
previously. New files have as-of-yet unknown hash values that cannot have been entered into

our database of previously found files of interest,

INVESTIGATORY DETAILS
During my the course of my investigations of Ares, my investigative program identified a
computer with the IP address 98.228.124.179 as a potential download candidate (source) for a
file of investigative interest. ‘That JP address geolocates to Mishawaka, indiana and appears to
be owned by Comeust Internet Services. 1 have obtained a download of a file from a computer at
98.228.124.279. | viewed the movie file and I believe that it represents child pornography as
defined by both state of Indiana and federal law. A description of the video Follows:

© On March 24, 2017, my RoundUp Ares program identified 98.228.124.179 as an IP

address that had a file of interest available. 1 was able to download a part of a video file
from that IP address around 5:00PM EST. 1 confirmed this conneclion and download via
log [les maintained during the download. The file’s name was “$rr9s90a(3).mpg.” The
segment of the video filc I downloaded is approximately 6 seconds long (though the
entire file appears to be 6:50 long. ‘The video begins with three boys approximately 8-10
years old, naked, on their hands and knees on a bed, Their scrotums are visible as they
bounce around and wrestle. The last portion acquired shows one of the boys sitting up on
the bed, completely naked, with his left hand on his exposed penis,

Through my training and experience, ] believe that people who search for and view child
pomography generally kecp the items they collect, And even if person deletes the item after
some period of time, a forensic computer examination often can find part (or all) of the deleted
files on the person’s hard drive; it is very difficult to successfully remove all traces of'a deleted

file from a hard drive. Further, | know thal the Arcs program contains database files that contain

listings of all files downloaded and shared in that a forensic examination of the user's computer
can show a history of activity by that machine using Ares. The Ares client records the digital
fingerprint of ail files successfully downloaded. According my RoundLp Ares tool, the user at
98.228.124.179 has been seen with 17 different files of investigative interest since February
2017. As recently as yesterday, May 24, 2017, the user reported having five different files of
investigative interest on that day alone. As I type this affidavit, the user at 98.228.124.179 is
currently online on Ares (as of 8:10AM on May 25, 2017).

On May 235, 2017, a query on the IP address 98.228.124.179 was conducted through the
American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) via whatismyipaddress.com. | received
information that the IP address is registered to Comcast Intemct Services. I believe thata
subpoena to Comcast to identify the subscrider(s) who was/were using 98.228.124.179 on March
24, 2017 through today, May 25, 2017 is relevant 10 my ongoing investigation into the
possession and distribution of child pornography. Further, I belicve that the facts and
information contained within this affidavit represent specific, articulable facts that show there are
reasonable grounds to believe the records sought are relevant and materiaf to an ongoing criminal
investigation as is the standard under federal law pursuant to 18 U.S.C, § 2703(d).

Finally, I believe that notice of this investigation will necessarily alert the target user that
law enforcement has begun to take sicps to identify them, ‘The possession of child pomography
is a state and federal felony; if convicted, the person faces both incarceration and placement on
the sex offender registry. 1 believe that any notice of our interest will result in reasonable
individuals taking steps to thwart our investigation including destroying evidence, taking steps to
sceurcly destroy evidence (means of which ane available via a simple google scarch), applying
encryption to evidence drives, and otherwise adversely affecting our ability to effectively
determine the identity of the user whose machine provided us with child abuse imagery.

1 affirm, under the penalties for perjury that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the

foregoing is true and accurate.
