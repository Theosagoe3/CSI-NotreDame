THE EXECUTION OF A SEARCH fBROPOSED] ORDER COMPELLING APPLE,

INC. TO ASSIST AGENTS IN SEARCH

AARRANT ON A BLACK LEXUS IS300,

This matter is before the Court pursuant to an application
pursuant to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651, by Assistant United
States Attorneys Tracy Wilkison and Allen Chiu, requesting an order
directing Apple Inc. (“Apple”) to assist law enforcement agents in
enabling the search of a digital device seized in the course of a
previously issued search warrant in this matter.

For good cause shown, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:

1. Apple shall assist in enabling the search of a cellular
telephone, Apple setlcere iPhone 5C, Model: A1532, P/N:MGFG2LL/A,

S/N: FFMNQ3MTG2DJ, IMET:358820052301412, on the Verizon Network, (the

“SUBJECT DEVICE”) pursuant to a warrant of this Court by providing
reasonable technical assistance to assist law enforcement agents in
obtaining access to the data on the SUBJECT DEVICE.

2: Apple's reasonable technical assistance shall accomplish
the following three important functions: (1) it will bypass or
disable the auto-erase function whether or not it has been enabled;
(2) it will enable the FBI to submit passcodes to the SUBJECT DEVICE
for testing electronically via the physical device port, Bluetooth,
Wi-Fi, or other protocol available on the SUBJECT DEVICE; and (3) it
will ensure that when the FBI submits passcodes to the SUBJECT
DEVICE, software running on the device will not purposefully
introduce any additional delay between passcode attempts beyond what
is incurred by Apple hardware.

3% Apple's reasonable technical assistance may include, but is |
not limited to: providing the FBI with a signed iPhone Software
file, recovery bundle, or other Software Image File (“SIF”) that can
be loaded onto the SUBJECT DEVICE. The SIF will load and run from
Random Access Memory (“RAM”) and will not modify the iOS on the
actual phone, the user data partition or system partition on the
device’s flash memory. The SIF will be coded by Apple with a unique
identifier of the phone so that the SIF would only load and execute
on the SUBJECT DEVICE. The SIF will be loaded via Device Firmware
Upgrade (“DFU”) mode, recovery mode, or other applicable mode
available to the FBI. Once active on the SUBJECT DEVICE, the SIF
will accomplish the three functions specified in paragraph 2. The
SIF will be loaded on the SUBJECT DEVICE at either a government
facility, or alternatively, at an Apple facility; if the latter,
Apple shall provide the government with remote access to the SUBJECT

DEVICE through a computer allowing the government to conduct passcode
recovery analysis.

4. If Apple determines that it can achieve the three functions
stated above in paragraph 2, as well as the functionality set forth
in paragraph 3, using an alternate technological means from that
recommended by the government, and the government concurs, Apple may
comply with this Order in that way.

Se. Apple shall advise the government of the reasonable cost of
providing this service.

6. Although Apple shall make reasonable efforts to maintain
the integrity of data on the SUBJECT DEVICE, Apple shall not be
required to maintain copies of any user data as a result of the
assistance ordered herein. All evidence preservation shall remain
the responsibility of law enforcement agents.

7. To the extent that Apple believes that compliance with this
Order would be unreasonably burdensome, it may make an application to
this Court for relief within five business days of receipt of the

Order.
