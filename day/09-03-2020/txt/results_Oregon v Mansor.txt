BALMER, C. J.

In this case, we consider defendant’s challenge
under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution, to a
warrant that authorized the search, seizure, and examina-
tion of his computer. Police investigated the injury of defen-
dant’s infant son while in defendant’s care on June 12, 2011.
The infant later died at the hospital. Defendant told the
police that his son had struggled to breathe and that he had
used his computer to look online for first aid advice before
calling 9-1-1. For that and other reasons, police seized and
then searched defendant’s computer as part of their inves-
tigation. The forensic examination of the computer found
internet search history shortly before the 9-1-1 call that was
generally consistent with defendant’s statements, but the
examination also revealed that defendant had visited web-
sites and entered search terms related to the abuse of infants
several times in the months and weeks prior to the infant’s
death. The trial court denied defendant’s motion to suppress
the latter evidence, and defendant was convicted of murder
and other crimes. The Court of Appeals reversed the convic-
tions, concluding that the warrant authorizing the search
of the computer violated the particularity requirement of
Article I, section 9, because it permitted the examination
of everything on defendant’s computer. State v. Mansor, 279
Or App 778, 801, 381 P3d 930 (2016). We allowed the state’s
petition for review of that decision and now affirm, although
our analysis differs in some respects from that of the Court
of Appeals.

For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that
the application of Article I, section 9, to warranted searches
of personal electronic devices requires a test that protects
an individual’s right to be free from unreasonable searches
and seizures while also recognizing the government’s law-
ful authority to obtain evidence in criminal investigations,
including through searches of digital data. A warrant to
search a computer or other digital device for information
related to a crime must be based on probable cause to believe
that such information will be found on the device. To sat-
isfy the particularity requirement of Article I, section 9, the
warrant must identify, as specifically as reasonably possi-
ble in the circumstances, the information to be searched for,
188 State v. Mansor

including, if available and relevant, the time period during
which the information was created, accessed, or otherwise
used. We acknowledge that, for practical reasons, searches
of computers are often comprehensive and therefore are
likely to uncover information that goes beyond the proba-
ble cause basis for the warrant. In light of that fact, to pro-
tect the right to privacy and to avoid permitting the digital
equivalent of general warrants, we also hold that Article I,
section 9, prevents the state from using evidence found in
a computer search unless a valid warrant authorized the
search for that particular evidence, or it is admissible under
an exception to the warrant requirement.

In this case, police had probable cause to believe
that defendant’s computer would contain information
regarding defendant’s internet searches shortly before his
9-1-1 call. We refer to that information as “the June 12
internet search history.” Defendant moved to suppress all
of the information found through the forensic examination
of the computer, which, as noted, included the evidence of
child abuse and other crimes dating from weeks and months
before the 9-1-1 call, as well as the June 12 internet search
history. The trial court found that the police lacked probable
cause to search the computer for any information beyond the
June 12 internet search history. Nevertheless, the trial court
denied defendant’s motion to suppress, and virtually all of
the relevant forensic evidence was admitted at trial. That
was error. In our view, the warrant was sufficiently partic-
ular to permit a search of the computer; however, the trial
court erred in admitting the proffered evidence that was
obtained as a result of the forensic examination, because,
as we read the warrant, it authorized the police to search
only for the June 12 internet search history. Accordingly, we
conclude that defendant’s motion to suppress should have
been granted in part and denied in part. Because that error
was not harmless, we affirm the Court of Appeals’ decision
reversing defendant’s convictions and remand the case to
the trial court.

I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW

On June 12, 2011, defendant called 9-1-1 at
2:22 p.m. and reported that his 11-week-old son, B, had
Cite as 363 Or 185 (2018) 189

stopped breathing. After an ambulance took the infant
to the hospital, Detective Rookhuyzen of the Washington
County Sheriff’s Office child abuse unit interviewed defen-
dant at his home. On the basis of information learned in
that interview and a pediatrician’s examination of B at the
hospital, Rookhuyzen applied for and obtained the warrant
which defendant now challenges.

Rookhuyzen prepared a seven-page affidavit in
support of his warrant application. The Court of Appeals
summarized the affidavit’s contents, which recounted
Rookhuyzen’s interactions with defendant and observations
of the home:

“At the beginning of the interview, Rookhuyzen noted
that defendant was ‘non-emotive—which, in Rookhuyzen’s
training and experience, was ‘highly unusual’ in such cir-
cumstances because ‘[p]arents are usually crying, sobbing,
and exhibiting signs of sadness or anxiety.’ Defendant told
Rookhuyzen that he had been home alone with B and his
twin brother, while his wife was working. According to
defendant, as he had been feeding B a mixture of formula
and liquid vitamins, the mixture had started to come out
of the baby’s nose and the baby had started coughing, so
defendant had turned him over, shaken him, and ‘smacked’
him on the back. The baby’s eyes became ‘fixed’ and ‘droopy,’
and his breathing became ‘very much labored.’ Defendant
told Rookhuyzen that he then shook B more, and the baby
began going ‘a minute or two between breaths.’

“Defendant did not call 9-1-1 at that point. Instead, he
told Rookhuyzen, he ‘went online’ on a computer in the
baby’s room to conduct research about what he should
do. When, after 15 minutes, the baby’s condition did not
improve, defendant called 9-1-1.

“Defendant did not call his wife during that period—
and, indeed, had not attempted to contact her by the time
Rookhuyzen began to interview him. In Rookhuyzen’s expe-
rience, that was ‘extremely unusual’: ‘[W]ith these kind of
incidents, spouses want to call each other instantly, even
before speaking with law enforcement.’

“Rookhuyzen’s affidavit further recounted that, at the
hospital, B was examined by a pediatrician, Dr. Lindsay,
who determined that the baby had no brain activity and
190 State v. Mansor

would die soon. Lindsay further determined, inter alia,
that the baby had experienced head trauma resulting in a
skull fracture, bi-lateral retinal hemorrhages, and an ‘old
rib fracture.’ In Lindsay’s opinion, defendant’s account was
not consistent with the baby’s condition, and he ultimately
rendered a diagnosis of ‘shaken baby syndrome’ as a result
of intentionally inflicted abuse.

««** Further, as specifically pertinent to the lawfulness
of the seizure and search of defendant’s computers, the affi-
davit included the following averment:

“T know based upon my training and experience
that computers can be connected to the internet to find
information using computer software that browse inter-
net sites for information. Internet search engine sites
such as Google and Yahoo! are often used to search the
internet for information related to a user’s requests. I
know that the computer will retain a history of internet
sites visited and the search terms used on the internet.
I know that to retain the integrity of a computer’s mem-
ory and how the system was used, the computer needs to
be searched in a laboratory and carefully examined by a
trained computer forensic examiner in order to ensure
that the data is not corrupted, damaged, or otherwise
changed from the time when the machine was seized.
[Defendant] told me that he searched the internet
between the time he noticed [B] was having difficulty
breathing and the time he called emergency dispatch.
He told me that he was using a computer to search the
internet for advice on what he should do. When I was
in the residence, I saw two laptop computers and two
desktop computers. [Defendant] did not specify which
computer he was using just before he called 9-1-1.

“The affidavit also included a detailed description of defen-
dant’s residence. Finally, in a section titled ‘Conclusion, the
affidavit stated Rookhuyzen’s belief that there was proba-
ble cause to seize and search 11 types of evidence, including
‘[t]wo laptop computers in the residence’ and ‘[t]wo desktop
computer towers located in the office/baby room.’”

Mansor, 279 Or App at 780-81 (brackets in Mansor; foot-
notes omitted).

A circuit court judge signed the search warrant
that evening. The search warrant instructed executing
Cite as 363 Or 185 (2018) 191

officers to “seize and search and forensically examine the
following objects: See attachment A.” (Emphasis omitted.)
Attachment A was captioned “items to be searched for, to be
seized, and to be analyzed.” It repeated verbatim the list of
eleven items included in Rookhuyzen’s affidavit, including
“It]wo laptop computers” and “[t]wo desktop computer tow-
ers.” The warrant itself contained no instructions or limita-
tions regarding how the computers were to be analyzed.

The warrant was executed that night. Two laptop
computers, two desktop computers, and other items from
B’s room were seized. The computers were taken to the
Northwest Regional Computer Forensics Laboratory, oper-
ated by the FBI, which performed the forensic analysis. The
lab’s report summarized the request:

“[Rookhuyzen] requested that the [seized computer drives]
be examined for internet history and internet search terms
input by the user on [June 12] especially from 2pm onward.
Per a discussion with Det. Rookhuyzen, the suspect
searched the internet 15 minutes prior to calling 9-1-1 in
regards to his 11-week old child suffering injuries. Suspect
claimed that the internet searches were regarding how to
aid an injured infant. Pertinent examination results should
be regarding child abuse and a possible history thereof.”

When Rookhuyzen made the initial request to the lab, he
provided a list of 19 search terms. A week later, another
detective, Hays, added eight more search terms.!

The scope of the analysis of the computers expanded
further. The report noted that about a month after the ini-
tial request, a detective directed that the search of the com-
puter be expanded to include email, although no relevant
emails were ultimately located. The forensic examiners also
included in the report search terms that were not provided
by the detectives, but that, in their opinion, “yielded pos-
sibly pertinent results.”? The forensic examiner stated that

1 Tnitially, Rookhuyzen provided the following search terms: bruise, police,
child abuse, investigation, rib, fracture, broken rib, colic [spelled as “cholic”],
baby, babies, twin, breath, breathing, rescue, rescue breathing, CPR, care, abuse,
and physical abuse. Later, Hays added: father, anger / angry, crying, hurt / hurt-
ing, infant, evidence, explaining, and injuries.

2 Those search terms included “swelling,” “Kaliq Mansor,” “911,” and “Go the
Fuck to Sleep.”
192 State v. Mansor

he had no knowledge of the case itself, other than what
he had learned from the detective’s request regarding the
examination of the computers.

The report also summarized the lab’s methods and
findings. For each computer and laptop, the storage media
were removed and imaged.* An initial analysis revealed
that some of the hard drives had last been used in 2009, and
those were not examined further. For the remaining drives,
the forensic examiner assembled a “complete Internet his-
tory,” including “deleted Internet history records.” “Internet
history” is a broad term. The software used by the lab—“Net
Analysis”—compiled many types of data, for example, cook-
ies, cached data, “leaks,” and other types of data that are
generated as part of normal internet browsing activity, to
create the internet history dataset. Each piece of internet
history data might contain or be associated with informa-
tion useful to investigators, such as the identity of the com-
puter user logged in at the time, the time and date that a
particular web page was visited, or search terms entered
into search engines, but each piece of data was not associ-
ated with all of those types of information. For example, not
all records were associated with a date and time or revealed
how the user navigated to a particular web page.

The internet history dataset was compiled into a
large spreadsheet containing over 360,000 records dating
back to 2005—six years before B was born. Net Analysis
allowed the forensic examiner to search for text in any of the

° At trial, the forensic examiner testified that imaging digital storage media
means making “an exact bit-by-bit duplication of all of the data on the hard drive.
**** [A]ll examination from that point on is done on [that] image, so that if any-
thing should happen to corrupt the data, I’m not corrupting the original hard
drive. *** So it maintains the integrity of the original evidence.” See also ORS
133.539(1)(a)(A) (“Forensic imaging’ means using an electronic device to down-
load or transfer raw data from a portable electronic device onto another medium
of digital storage.”).

4 The forensic examiner also explained many of those terms. A cookie is “a
little piece of data that [a] website is going to leave on your local computer that
will help you the next time you access the same website.” Cached data is infor-
mation on a web page that a computer stores locally, enabling faster loading the
next time the user accesses the same web page. A leak is “an artifact of browsing
history. It basically means the browser was trying to delete a piece of the Internet
history just for normal cleanup or if the history was trying to be deleted by a user,
*** and for some reason it couldn’t *** so it sort of generates an error and that
error is called a leak.”

websites visited and to organize the internet history records
by date and time. In addition to a printed summary of its
findings, the lab provided detectives with a DVD containing
that dataset and several lengthy reports on specific searches
requested by detectives. For example, one report listed all
web URLs visited on the date of the 9-1-1 call, beginning with
a visit to Netflix nine seconds after midnight and continuing
until that afternoon. That report is 630 pages long. Another
report that listed results for the search term “abuse” was
101 pages long, and contained URLs dating from a 16 month
period as well as many other URLs not associated with a
date and time. The lab also provided reports for the search
terms that “originated during the examination” as yield-
ing “possibly pertinent results,” listed above. Similarly, the
DVD contained files that were not internet history, but that
the forensic examiner believed might be relevant, such as
a Microsoft Word document containing a narrative descrip-
tion of the child’s birth, photos of B, and a downloaded com-
puter game that allowed the user to simulate child abuse.

Before trial, defendant moved to suppress the evi-
dence discovered on the computers, arguing that the war-
rant was “worded so broadly as to constitute a general war-
rant.” Defendant suggested that “search protocols” should
have been included in the warrant to restrict the potentially
unlimited search of the computer hard drives. A search
protocol, for example, could limit the search to specific files
or types of data on the computer—such as emails, internet
searches, or photographs—or to search terms used in an
internet browser. See United States v. Comprehensive Drug
Testing, Inc., 621 F3d 1162, 1179 (9th Cir 2010) (on rehear-
ing en banc) (Kozinski, C.J., concurring) (discussing search
protocols in warrants to search computers).

The trial court denied the motion in a written opin-
ion. The trial court first noted that defendant had conceded
that the search warrant properly permitted law enforce-
ment officials to search the computers for the June 12
internet search history. The court then rejected defendant’s
argument that the lack of search protocols in the warrant
rendered the warrant unconstitutional, noting that the
majority view is that such protocols are not constitutionally
required. The court found that the affidavit did not provide
194 State v. Mansor

probable cause to search the computer for evidence of any
crimes other than those related to B’s injuries on June 12.
Nevertheless, and apparently relying on the “traditional
rules for the plain view exception,” the court concluded that
“all evidence obtained through the execution of the warrant
[was] admissible.”

At trial, Detective Hays relied on the forensic lab’s
reports to testify about defendant’s internet history. He
stated that shortly before the 9-1-1 call, defendant searched
the term “baby pulse no breathing”—a search consistent
with defendant’s explanation of events. The focus of Hays’s
testimony on defendant’s internet history, however, was com-
puter activity that occurred before that day. Interpreting
reports generated by the forensic examiner, Hays concluded
that on five separate occasions—the day of the 9-1-1 call
and four earlier occasions, the earliest 54 days before the
call—the computer had been used to conduct searches about
or related to child abuse. The prosecutor implied that the
search terms typed into the computer, often in quick suc-
cession, provided a snapshot of defendant’s thought process
and conduct. For example, three days before the 9-1-1 call,
there were many relevant searches, including, at 6:24 a.m.,
a search for “afraid of abusing my baby,” then shortly after
that, “how do I deal with a screaming baby,” then three min-
utes later, “baby, swelling, back of head.”®

The evidence gathered from defendant’s computer
was undoubtedly helpful to the state’s case. In the state’s
closing argument, the prosecutor called internet search his-
tory “a looking glass” into a person’s character and “a record

* The plain view doctrine “permit|s] the officers to seize evidence without a
warrant if, in the course of executing [the] search warrant and while they were
in a place where they had a right to be, they had probable cause to believe that
evidence that they saw was either contraband or evidence of a crime.” State v.
Carter, 342 Or 39, 45, 147 P3d 1151 (2006). The state did not rely on the “plain
view” exception to the warrant requirement in the Court of Appeals and does not
rely upon that exception before this court. We discuss the doctrine again briefly
later in this opinion.

® Detective Hays testified about other incriminating phrases that appeared
in the search history without disclosing the date of those searches. Those included
“how do I stop abusing my baby,” “infant abuse,” “signs of newborn abuse,” “hold-
ing baby upside down cause brain damage,” “infant attachment father,” “how to
quiet a crying infant,” “abuser therapy,” “battered newborn,” and “father hates
infant.”
Cite as 363 Or 185 (2018) 195

of what’s going on in [defendant’s] head.” The prosecutor
recited strings of sequential search terms to the jury, such as
those quoted above, and used those to speculate about defen-
dant’s thought process. Defendant’s ex-wife and B’s mother
also relied on the internet history to understand what had
happened. She said that in the first two weeks after B’s
death, she supported defendant because she couldn't believe
that he would hurt B. But “[w]hen the evidence came to light
about [defendant’s] computer searches, I stopped supporting
him.”

The state charged defendant with six counts relat-
ing to three discrete incidents of abuse against B and B’s
twin in the weeks before B’s death, and four counts relat-
ing to the incident that caused B’s death. After an eleven
day trial, the jury convicted defendant of all charged counts:
murder, assault in the first degree, three counts of assault in
the third degree, and three counts of criminal mistreatment
in the first degree.

On appeal, defendant challenged the warrant
as facially invalid because it failed to satisfy the particu-
larity requirement of Article I, section 9, of the Oregon
Constitution. Defendant also asserted that, to determine
whether the warrant was valid, the court should look at the
warrant alone and not consider information contained in the
affidavit that supported the warrant application.

The Court of Appeals first addressed whether its
review of the warrant was limited to the face of the warrant
or whether it also could look at the affidavit. Mansor, 279
Or App at 788. It noted that the state had introduced evi-
dence at trial that supported its contention that the affidavit
was attached to the warrant at the time defendant’s house
was searched, and that defendant had not produced any
evidence to the contrary. Jd. at 790. A defendant bears the
burden to rebut the presumption that a warranted search is
valid. State v. Walker, 350 Or 540, 553, 258 P3d 1228 (2011).
Because defendant had not presented any evidence support-
ing his argument, the court held that it would consider the
contents of the affidavit in the challenge to the warrant.
Mansor, 279 Or App at 791.
196 State v. Mansor

But on the broader issue of the warrant’s validity,
the court held that, even considering the information in the
affidavit as well as the warrant, the warrant was unconstitu-
tionally overbroad in authorizing the forensic examination of
defendant’s computers. It recognized that the case presented
a question of first impression and reviewed decisions from
other courts, some of which invalidated computer search
warrants for failing to meet particularity requirements. It
quoted with approval Wheeler v. State, 135 A8d 282 (Del
2016), which adopted a requirement that warrants “describe
what investigating officers believe will be found on electronic
devices with as much specificity as possible under the cir-
cumstances.” Mansor, 279 Or App at 796 (quoting Wheeler,
135 A3d at 304). The court, in light of the “unique function-
ality and capacity of electronic devices,” concluded that

“for purposes of the constitutional particularity require-
ment, personal electronic devices are more akin to the
‘place’ to be searched than to the ‘thing’ to be seized and
examined. Concomitantly, that requires that the search of
that ‘place’ be limited to the ‘thing(s)’—the digital data—
for which there is probable cause to search.”

Id. at 801.

The court then applied that rule. It read the war-
rant and affidavit as establishing probable cause

“with respect to internet searches during the 15-minute
period preceding the 9-1-1 call—and, arguably, with respect
to all electronic communications and photos during the
entire time that B was in defendant’s care on June 12, 2011.
However, nothing in Rookhuyzen’s affidavit established
probable cause that a temporally unlimited examination of
the contents of defendant’s computers, including of files and
functions unrelated to internet searches and emails, would
yield other evidence of the events of June 12, 2011.”

Id. at 802. The court also found that the trial court’s error
in denying the motion to suppress was not harmless and,
for those reasons, reversed and remanded. We allowed the
state’s petition for review to consider those important issues.

7 The Court of Appeals and the parties used the terms “location” and “place”
as a convenient way to discuss searches of electronic devices, but they acknowl-
edge that those analogies are imperfect. We agree and, for reasons discussed in
the text, find the analytical value of those analogies to be limited.

II. THE DIGITAL CONTEXT

Before addressing the parties’ legal arguments,
it is helpful to identify some of the ways that digital data,
whether stored on a computer or other digital device, dif-
fers from physical evidence. First, raw digital data—the 1s
and Os that make up binary signals—must be processed and
displayed by intermediating programs and hardware to be
meaningful. A user may conceive of the information on her
computer as being “files,” organized into “folders” that are
stored in various locations on the computer and accessed
through particular software programs. But a computer
forensic examiner views the same data differently. As demon-
strated by the facts of this case, a category of information
that is a likely source of evidence—say, the internet search
history on a given computer—may be composed of many
types of data and files, and the physical locations of data on
a computer hard drive and even the software's organization
of those data and files may be unrelated to the user’s percep-
tion of how their data is organized. See Josh Goldfoot, The
Physical Computer and the Fourth Amendment, 16 Berkeley
J Crim L 112, 128 (2011) (explaining that “files do not corre-
spond to organizational choices made by computer users”).

Similarly, some data on a computer may not be in
the form of “files.” For example, when a user deletes a file,
fragments of the file’s raw data often continue to exist on the
hard drive. A forensic examiner may be able to reconstitute
a new file from that residual data that can then be read by
a program. That concept—that digital information is per-
ceived in fundamentally different ways by users than by
forensic examiners—means that a user’s honest statements
about a file, such as “it’s in the ‘My Documents’ folder,” “that
document is gone, I didn’t save it,” or “no one can use my
computer without my password,” may not be “true” to a
forensic examiner.® We discuss the implications of the fore-
going context below.

® Forensic examiners have many potential sources of evidence not apparent
to a casual computer user:

“When a computer user accesses a web site, opens a file, launches a pro-
gram, starts the computer, shuts it down, logs on, logs off, installs software,
removes software, or attaches a flash drive, hard drives reflect those actions.
Forensic analysts term such evidence ‘artifacts.’ Like archaeological artifacts
198 State v. Mansor

Digital evidence also differs from physical evidence
in that, for most files, there is no way to know what data a
file contains without opening it, meaning that desired data
may be located in any part of the digital media or organi-
zational structure. Indeed, data stored on a computer hard
drive may be physically located in multiples places on the
drive, and it is unhelpful and often inaccurate to think of the
data as being located at any particular “place” or “places.”
In the physical world, a handgun cannot be disguised as—
and will not be mistaken for—a kitchen table, nor will it be
found in a pill bottle. But in the virtual world, that kind of
deception—or error—is possible. A picture file may be inten-
tionally disguised as a text file, for example, by changing
the extension of the file name or by including the picture
in a Microsoft Word document, which would be properly
saved as a .doc (or similar) file. A picture file may contain
text information if, for example, the picture is of a page of
a book. Sophisticated users can hide digital data in much
more complex ways, including changing date and time meta-
data and encrypting files so that they cannot be opened. See
Orin S. Kerr, Executing Warrants for Digital Evidence: The
case for use restrictions on nonresponsive data, 48 Tex Tech
L Rev 1, 16 (2015) (“Data can always be changed. Maybe
the modification will be easy or maybe it will be hard. But
it can always be done.”). Similarly, information can be hid-
den unintentionally. Most of us have had the experience of
neglecting to name or properly “save” a document, only to
have it disappear into an obscure temporary file, with its
sole identifier a number assigned by the software. And even
those with limited computer skills can easily delete their
internet search “history” on a particular internet browser,

 

showing how people once lived, forensic artifacts show how computers were
used. Log files show what software programs did. Virtual memory paging
files can reveal what was once in memory. Temporary files and link files can
reveal that someone created, opened, or saved particular files. When a user
saves a file in Microsoft Word, for example, eight different files or folders
are created, modified, or accessed in sixteen different steps, all occurring
in less than a second. In Windows, a vast configuration database, called the
‘registry, is an evidence treasure chest, showing recent user commands,
recent files opened, recent network drives accessed, recent web sites visited,
whether USB flash drives were attached, what Wi-Fi wireless access points
have been used, and more.”

Goldfoot, 16 Berkeley J Crim L at 127-28 (2011) (footnotes omitted).

although evidence of those searches will likely remain else-
where on the hard drive. A forensic examiner who locates
intentionally (or unintentionally) hidden information on a
computer likely has responded to clues, followed instincts,
and pursued many dead ends before being successful. See
Orin S. Kerr, Searches and Seizures in a Digital World, 119
Harv L Rev 531, 545 (2005) (“[G]ood forensic analysis is an
art more than a science.”).

For those reasons, commentators and courts some-
times refer to searches of computers in a criminal investiga-
tion as involving “two basic steps: the data acquisition phase
and the data reduction phase.” Kerr, 119 Harv L Rev at 547;
see also United States v. Stabile, 633 F3d 219, 234 (3d Cir
2011), cert den, 565 US 942 (2011) (applying two step per-
spective). In the data acquisition phase, the warrant autho-
rizes the police to search a location for a computer and to
seize it. As we discuss below, that physical search and sei-
zure must comply with constitutional requirements, includ-
ing the usual particularity rules for describing the physi-
cal place to be searched and the computer to be seized. But,
generally, the seized computer or data itself has not yet been
determined to have any evidentiary value.’

In the data reduction phase, there is an examina-
tion (“search”) of the digital data, this time by a forensic
examiner, to identify the particular data that may be use-
ful as evidence. Using the familiar analogy of searching for
a needle in a haystack, “data acquisition refers to collect-
ing the hay, and data reduction involves looking through
the haystack for the needle.” Kerr, 119 Harv L Rev at 547.
Because, as noted earlier, the location or form of specific
information on a computer often cannot be known before
the computer is actually examined, examiners conducting a
reasonable computer search ordinarily will be permitted to
look widely on the computer’s hard drive to ensure that all

® Our discussion here is limited to circumstances where police seek data or
information stored in the computer or evidence of the use of the computer as a
computer. The analysis would be different, of course, if a laptop computer had
been used to assault a person physically or was alleged to have been stolen. In
those cases, police might seize the computer to test for DNA or fingerprint evi-
dence, rather than to search the hard drive, and the possible seizure of the com-
puter would be for evidentiary purposes more akin to those involved in searches
for and seizures of other “things.”

material within the scope of the warrant is found. Goldfoot,
16 Berkley J Crim L at 141 (noting consensus among fed-
eral circuit courts permitting “human forensic examiners
to look at every file, albeit briefly, to determine whether
it is in the warrant’s scope”; citing cases); see Andresen v.
Maryland, 427 US 463, 482 n 11, 96 S Ct 2737, 49 L Ed 2d
627 (1976) (holding, in nondigital context, that warranted
search of attorney’s office for certain papers did not violate
Fourth Amendment when executing officers “cursorily”
examined “innocuous documents *** to determine whether
they [were], in fact, among those papers authorized to be
seized”). For that reason, courts generally have not required
that warrants include specific search protocols or ex ante
limitations on computer searches. See Stabile, 633 F3d at
238 (“[I]t would be folly for a search warrant to structure the
mechanics of the search because imposing such limits would
unduly restrict legitimate search objectives.” (Internal quo-
tation marks omitted.)); Wayne R. LaFave, 2 Search and
Seizure § 4.10(d), 969 (5th ed 2012) (noting courts are “dis-
inclined” to impose ex ante search limitations). Moreover, a
magistrate presented with a search warrant request, often
early in a criminal investigation, would have little basis to
make an informed decision as to whether proposed protocols
regarding the seizure and search of a computer are sufficient
to protect constitutional privacy interests or impose a consti-
tutionally unnecessary burden on a criminal investigation.
See Orin S. Kerr, Ex Ante Regulation of Computer Search
and Seizure, 96 Va L Rev 1241, 1293 (2010) (“The factual
vacuum of ex ante and ex parte decisionmaking leads such
restrictions to introduce constitutional errors that inadver-
tently prohibit reasonable search and seizure practices.”).

Finally, the novel nature of digital devices has
led courts to apply search and seizure principles to those
devices in a manner somewhat different from other physi-
cal evidence. The Supreme Court addressed some of those
issues in Riley v. California, __US __, 1384S Ct 2473, 189 L
Ed 2d 430 (2014), and we discuss that case as background,
because many of the parties’ arguments in this case about
searches of digital devices also were raised there.

In Riley, the Court considered a petitioner’s post-
conviction challenge to the warrantless search of his “smart
Cite as 363 Or 185 (2018) 201

phone” that police officers found in his pocket at the time of
his arrest following a traffic stop and that they later exam-
ined at the police station.° Jd. at 2480-81. The police found,
among other things, gang-affiliated material and a photo of
the defendant with a car linked to a shooting; the evidence
ultimately supported his conviction for three crimes, includ-
ing attempted murder, that were unrelated to the initial
arrest. Id. at 2481. The government argued that, because
the phone had been lawfully seized when the defendant was
arrested, any information on the phone also was legitimately
seized and could be used at trial. The government suggested
that a search of all data on a cell phone was “materially
indistinguishable” from searches of other physical items
that might be found in a defendant’s pocket. Jd. at 2488.

The Court rejected that argument:

“That is like saying a ride on horseback is materially indis-
tinguishable from a flight to the moon. *** Modern cell
phones, as a category, implicate privacy concerns far beyond
those implicated by the search of a cigarette pack, a wallet,
or a purse. A conclusion that inspecting the contents of an
arrestee’s pockets works no substantial additional intru-
sion on privacy beyond the arrest itself may make sense as
applied to physical items, but any extension of that reason-
ing to digital data has to rest on its own bottom.”

Id. at 2488-89. The Court identified the several ways in
which cell phones “differ in both a quantitative and a qual-
itative sense” from other objects that might be found on an
arrestee’s person—and many of those characteristics also
describe defendant’s computer here. Jd. at 2489.

The Court noted that the “immense storage capac-
ity” of cell phones means that the physical limitation on the

1 Riley consisted of two consolidated cases, one involving a “smart phone”
and the other a “flip phone.” Riley, 134 S Ct at 2480-81. The Court used the term
“cell phone” to encompass both, and we follow that usage in discussing the case.
The Court noted that many cell phones “are in fact minicomputers.” Id. at 2489.
We agree that different species of personal digital devices, such as tablets, smart
phones, laptops, and desktop computers, share many of the attributes discussed
in Riley. As the state points out, treating some digital devices—such as the
phones in Riley and the computers here—as unlike other “things” for some con-
stitutional purposes requires determining whether a specific digital device falls
within the category of items that must be seized and searched pursuant to the
rules discussed in this opinion. We leave to future cases the determination of the
specific boundaries of that category.
202 State v. Mansor

amount of information a person could carry no longer applied.
Id. at 2489. A large storage capacity means that even a sin-
gle category of information, such as emails or photographs,
can “convey far more than previously possible. The sum of
an individual’s private life can be reconstructed through
a thousand photographs labeled with dates, locations, and
descriptions; the same cannot be said of a photograph or two
of loved ones tucked into a wallet.” Jd. Further, a cell phone
collects “many distinct types of information—an address, a
note, a prescription, a bank statement, a video—that reveal
much more in combination that any isolated record.” Id.
Internet history can reveal “an individual’s private inter-
ests or concerns”; location data can show where a person has
been; and apps on a phone may provide information about,
for example, an individual's political views, addiction treat-
ment, dating, buying and selling, pregnancy, budgeting, and
communicating. Id. at 2490. The Court not only rejected the
government’s claim that a cell phone was more like a “thing”
than a “place,” it also stated that even treating a cell phone
like a house is insufficient to protect the privacy interests
that many individuals have in the information stored in
their phones:

“{A] cell phone search would typically expose to the govern-
ment far more than the most exhaustive search of a house:
A phone not only contains in digital form many sensitive
records previously found in the home; it also contains a
broad array of private information never found in a home
in any form—unless the phone is.”

Id. at 2491 (emphasis in original).

The Court explained that the development of the
cell phone had undermined assumptions supporting the inci-
dent to arrest exception to the warrant requirement; with
a cell phone, an arrestee could be carrying the equivalent
of all the information in his house, or more. Therefore, the
Court held that the exception could not be used to justify the
search of cell phones, and it instead directed officers seeking
to examine the contents of a cell phone to “get a warrant.”
Id. at 2495.

In this case, of course, the officers had a war-
rant, and we return to the facts here and the question of
Cite as 363 Or 185 (2018) 203

the validity of the warrant and the search of defendant’s
computer.

III. MAY THE AFFIDAVIT BE CONSIDERED
WITH THE WARRANT?

We first address the issue of whether the informa-
tion contained in Rookhuyzen’s affidavit is properly consid-
ered part of the warrant itself. In the Court of Appeals, the
state asserted that the affidavit was “attached to and refer-
enced by” the warrant and, as a result, the court should con-
sider the contents of the affidavit as part of the warrant in
deciding defendant’s challenge to the warrant’s facial valid-
ity. In his response, defendant agreed that an affidavit may
be considered part of the warrant if it physically accompa-
nies the warrant and the warrant explicitly incorporates it
by reference; however, defendant disputed that the state had
established that the warrant here met those requirements,
and, therefore, he claimed that the contents of the affidavit
should not be considered."

The Court of Appeals observed that, when a search
is conducted pursuant to a warrant, the defendant bears
“the burden of establishing facts pertaining to his ‘challenge
[to] the validity of the warrant itself”” Mansor, 279 Or App
at 790 (quoting Walker, 350 Or at 555 (brackets in Mansor)).
Here, the state’s contention that the affidavit was attached
to and referenced in the warrant at the time of execution
was supported, as the Court of Appeals said, by “permissi-
ble, albeit hardly indubitable, inference.” Jd. Defendant pre-
sented no evidence to controvert that inference. Jd. On that
record, the Court of Appeals concluded that defendant fell
short of his burden of production and therefore considered
the affidavit to be part of the warrant for purposes of its
review.

We agree with the Court of Appeals that defendant
failed in the trial court to establish the factual basis for his
argument on appeal; for purposes of this case, we consider
the text of the affidavit to be part of the warrant. That said,

4 The warrant did not contain the word “affidavit.” It did, however, reference
“Attachment A,” which was a separate document listing items to be seized. The
state presented evidence, which defendant did not controvert, that the affidavit
was stapled to “Attachment A.”
204 State v. Mansor

we note that parties may spend substantial time litigating
whether the contents of an affidavit should be considered in
a challenge to a warrant. See LaFave, 2 Search and Seizure
§ 4.6(1) at 778 (noting a “great variety of viewpoints” on the
issue). In our view, rather than relying on indirect infer-
ences to establish a connection between the warrant and an
affidavit, the better practice is for the warrant to include
specific text from the affidavit or to incorporate the affida-
vit by express reference in the warrant. Merely attaching
the affidavit or an exhibit with an attached affidavit to the
warrant, without some textual reference, creates the ambig-
uous situation apparently present here. Moreover, as we dis-
cuss in greater detail below, in order to guide the persons
conducting the forensic examination of a properly seized
computer, the warrant itself should describe, with as much
specificity as reasonably possible, the category or categories
of information to be searched for on the computer, including,
if available and relevant, the time period when the informa-
tion was created, accessed, or otherwise used. That descrip-
tion, of course, must be based on affidavits or other record
evidence that establishes probable cause to search the com-
puter for such information.

Because we have concluded that the affidavit should
be considered as part of the warrant in this case, it follows
that the contents of the affidavit assist us in determining
the scope of the search that the warrant permitted. The
warrant itself authorized police to “seize and search and
forensically examine” certain items listed in an attachment,
and the listed items included defendant’s computers. The
affidavit also referred to, and sought authority to search for
and seize, those items, and an exhibit to the affidavit refers
to “items to be searched for, to be seized, and to be ana-
lyzed.” The only reference in the affidavit to relevant infor-
mation that Rookhuyzen believed was on the computer was
the paragraph set out above, 363 Or __,__ (and one related
sentence in the affidavit), regarding defendant’s statements
about searching the internet for first aid advice in the fifteen
minutes before he made the 9-1-1 call. Although the war-
rant, supplemented by the affidavit, authorized the “search,”
“analy(sis],” and “forensic[] examinatlion]” of all the items
seized, including the computers, the only description of
Cite as 363 Or 185 (2018) 205

any relevant information that Rookhuyzen believed might
be found on the computers was that of the June 12 inter-
net search history. We therefore view that description of
the information to be searched for as a limitation on the
search, analysis, and forensic examination authorized by
the warrant.”

IV. IS THE WARRANT VALID?
A. Search and Seizure Principles and History

This case raises questions under Article I, section
9, of the specificity with which a warrant must describe the
digital information that the state seeks, the search that the
state may conduct, and the evidence that the state may use
when police have probable cause to believe that a computer
contains information related to a crime. Those questions
implicate fundamental issues of personal privacy and the
state’s responsibility to prosecute crime in the novel and
rapidly evolving context of digital evidence. Although this
court previously has addressed the application of Article I,
section 9, to some types of electronic evidence, we have not
yet considered the application of the constitutional princi-
ples to the unique characteristics of a personal computer.

To do so, “we consider the ‘specific wording of
Article I, section 9, the case law surrounding it, and the
historical circumstances that led to its creation.” State v.
Carter, 342 Or 39, 42, 147 P3d 1151 (2006) (quoting Priest
v. Pearce, 314 Or 411, 415-16, 840 P2d 65 (1992) (brackets
omitted)). The purpose of the historical analysis required
under Priest is not to “freeze” the meaning of the state con-
stitution at the time of its adoption. State v. Davis, 350 Or
440, 446, 256 P3d 1075 (2011). “Rather it is to identify, in
light of the meaning understood by the framers, relevant
underlying principles that may inform our application of the
constitutional text to modern circumstances.” Id.

Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution
provides:

22 Unless the context indicates otherwise, when we refer to the “warrant”
in the remainder of this opinion, we mean the warrant, as supplemented by the
affidavit.
206 State v. Mansor

“No law shall violate the right of the people to be secure
in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unrea-
sonable search, or seizure; and no warrant shall issue but
upon probable cause, supported by oath, or affirmation, and
particularly describing the place to be searched, and the
person or thing to be seized.”

Using that text as a starting point, we review this court’s
Article I, section 9, case law and our earlier discussions of
historical circumstances. We consider whether the unique
characteristics of computers make them unlike other
“things” that may be seized. Then we determine what
it means to “particularly describle] *** [the] thing to be
seized” in the warrant, when that “thing” is information on
a computer. Finally, we apply the results of our discussion to
the facts of this case.

The text and principles of Article I, section 9, can
be traced directly to the Fourth Amendment to the United
States Constitution, and from there to state constitutional
documents dating to the American Revolution. See State v.
Bridewell, 306 Or 231, 241, 759 P2d 1054 (1988) (Peterson,
C.J., concurring in part, dissenting in part) (discussing his-
tory of Article I, section 9); see also Jack L. Landau, The
Search for the Meaning of Oregon’s Search and Seizure
Clause, 87 Or L Rev 819, 836-840 (2008) (recounting the
origins of Article I, section 9). Those provisions themselves
were, among other things, reactions to abusive “general war-
rants” of the English colonial government, which gave gov-
ernment agents “unlimited authority to search and seize.”
State v. Blackburn/Barber, 266 Or 28, 34, 511 P2d 381
(1973) (explaining that a historical motivation for Article I,
section 9, was a fear of general warrants); see also Landau,
87 Or L Rev at 822-23 (“‘General warrants’ referred to writs
that authorized the bearer to search unspecified places or
arrest persons suspected of having been involved with a
criminal offense.”); Laura K. Donohue, The Original Fourth
Amendment, 83 U Chi L Rev 1181 (2016) (relating the role of
general warrants in the framers’ development of the Fourth
Amendment).

As we have previously explained, “[t]he privacy
interests protected from unreasonable searches under
Cite as 363 Or 185 (2018) 207

Article I, section 9, are defined by an objective test of whether
the government’s conduct ‘would significantly impair an
individual’s interest in freedom from scrutiny, i.e., his pri-
vacy.’” State v. Wacker, 317 Or 419, 425, 856 P2d 1029 (1993)
(quoting State v. Dixson/Digby, 307 Or 195, 211, 766 P2d
1015 (1988)). Because “private space and privacy interests
often are inextricably intertwined[,] *** privacy interests
that are protected by Article I, section 9, commonly are
circumscribed by the space in which they exist and, more
particularly, by the barriers to public entry (physical and
sensory) that define that private space.” State v. Smith, 327
Or 366, 372-73, 963 P2d 642 (1998) (emphasis in original).
At the same time, we have recognized that Article I, section
9, “must be read in light of the ever-expanding capacity of
individuals and the government to gather information by
technological means.” Id. at 373. That is, Article I, section
9, applies to “every possible form of invasion—physical, elec-
tronic, technological, and the like.” Id. We discuss the per-
missible scope of that legal intrusion below.

B. Search for and Seizure of Computers
1. Seizure of the computers

We begin by considering briefly the search for and
seizure of defendant’s computers themselves. Although
defendant’s motion to suppress challenged the seizure of the
computers as well as the forensic examination of the com-
puters for evidence and the use of that evidence at trial,
defendant no longer argues that the seizure of the physical
computers violated Article I, section 9. That argument would
fail in any event. The warrant recounted defendant’s state-
ments to Rookhuysen about his internet searches, identified
two laptop computers and two desktop computer towers in
the apartment, and included statements by Rookhuyzen
about how internet search engines are used to seek infor-
mation (as defendant stated that he had done when B was
not breathing) and about the need to have an examination
conducted by a trained computer forensic examiner. The
warrant was sufficiently particular in its description of the
computers to be seized and the grounds for believing that
evidence related to the criminal investigation was likely to
be found on one or more of them to meet the particularity
208 State v. Mansor

requirement of Article I, section 9, with respect to the sei-
zure of the computers.

2. Search of a lawfully seized computer

The more difficult issue is whether the warrant’s
authorization of lawful seizure of the computers similarly
authorized the state to conduct a search of the computers
to locate and seize information or data on the computers for
evidence of a crime. The principles underlying Article I, sec-
tion 9, establish that an individual generally has a privacy
interest in the information on his or her personal computer.
A computer often is either located in a private space, such as
a home, or secured by a password or biometric identification,
or both. Those “barriers to public entry” are the sort contem-
plated in Smith, 327 Or at 373, that indicate the presence of
constitutionally protected privacy interests. The state does
not disagree. The state argues, however, that if police obtain
a valid warrant to search for and seize a computer, they are
“free to examine it as they see fit.” The state asserts that
“a computer is a thing, and a warrant to examine it need
only identify the particular computer, not the data that the
examination is intended to find.” The state relies on cases
involving other “things” seized in warranted searches and
argues that once a “thing” is seized and examined for any
purpose, “any privacy interest in that object is destroyed,
and no purpose would be served by further limitation on
the nature of examinations that may be performed on the
object.”

We agree with defendant and the Court of Appeals
that the state’s argument is not well taken. For reasons that
we will explain, the fact that police have a warrant, based
on probable cause, to search for and seize “things,” including
computers, does not necessarily mean that they may con-
duct a comprehensive forensic examination of a computer
that they seize, and then use at trial anything they find on
the computer, without limit.

As noted, the state accepts that individuals have
a protected privacy interest in their computers and the
information on them. The state’s legal argument, however,
fails to account for the fact that, unlike most other “things”
Cite as 363 Or 185 (2018) 209

that may be seized in a search, a computer or other digital
device is a repository with an historically unprecedented
capacity to collect and store a diverse and vast array of per-
sonal information. Moreover, that information is stored in
a manner that ordinarily makes it inaccessible to others.
We discussed in detail above the reasons that computers
and digital devices are different from most other “things”
that can be seized in the course of criminal investigations
and the Supreme Court’s recognition in Riley that differ-
ent search and seizure rules apply to those devices than to
other “things.” Indeed, the state’s argument here is simi-
lar to the argument that the government made in Riley and
that the Supreme Court rejected: If the item (the phone or
computer) is lawfully seized, then any information that can
be discovered within the item also is legitimately seized and
can be used at trial. Although Riley involved a warrantless
search incident to arrest and this case involves a computer
seized pursuant to a warrant, defendant urges us to fol-
low the Court’s approach in Riley and hold that computers
deserve more protection than other “things” under Article I,
section 9.

The state argues that this court has previously
held that an individual retains no privacy interest in stor-
age media that is lawfully in the possession of the police. In
State v. Munro, 339 Or 545, 124 P3d 1221 (2005), the police
raided a home pursuant to a warrant in connection with a
drug investigation and seized a beta format videotape and
various contraband. The defendant was prosecuted for pos-
session of the other contraband, but the videotape appeared
to be blank. About a year later, acting on new information,
police were able to view the contents of the tape, discovered
that it contained child pornography, and prosecuted defen-
dant based on that evidence. The defendant challenged the
later examination of the tape—which the state conceded was
a “search”—as violating Article I, section 9. This court held
that no violation had occurred, because “[o]nce the police
seized the videotape under the authority of the warrant,
any privacy interest that defendant had in the contents of
the videotape was destroyed by the authority of the warrant
permitting the examination and exhibition of the contents of
the videotape.” Id. at 552.
210 State v. Mansor

The state erroneously assumes, however, that
the videotape in Munro is analogous to a computer or a
cell phone. Of the unique characteristics of the cell phone
described in Riley—such as containing many types of infor-
mation, having immense storage capacity, and playing a role
in many aspects of life—a videotape has none. In contrast
with a cell phone, which continually creates and stores data
as it is used, the only possible “search” of a videotape is for
the police to view the tape as it was recorded. Munro held
only that a single analog videotape is a “thing” for purposes
of search and seizure analysis, and once it was seized pur-
suant to a valid warrant, the owner lost all privacy interest
in it. That holding does not assist the state here.

Further, the state’s semantic observation that a
computer is literally a “thing” is a truism that does not com-
pel a legal conclusion. And the state provides no persuasive
rejoinder to the Court’s description in Riley of the technolog-
ical changes that led the Court to exempt cell phones from
the “search incident to arrest” doctrine. The data contained
on a personal computer is qualitatively and quantitatively
different from the sort of information that could be found in
other single objects, or even an entire house not containing
digital data. See Riley, 134 S Ct at 2491. We reject the state’s
argument that a computer is merely a “thing to be seized”
and that, once lawfully seized, the state is free to analyze or
examine the computer without limit and to use any informa-
tion that is found.

We observe at this point that the state does not
rely on the plain view doctrine—or any other exception to
the warrant requirement—to justify the seizure and use
at trial of information from defendant’s computer; instead,
its remaining arguments, which we discuss in detail below,
turn on the scope of the warrant. The plain view doctrine

13 We do not intend our discussion here of forensic examinations of computer
hard drives to call into question our “container” decisions, although the underly-
ing Article I, section 9, principles are at least similar, if not the same. See State
v. Heckathorne, 347 Or 474, 481-85, 223 P3d 1034 (2009) (discussing cases). As
we have emphasized throughout this opinion, because of (1) the vast and diverse
information that may be stored on a computer, and (2) the fact that the search of
a computer necessarily will discover information beyond that being searched for,
the rules that we articulate for applying Article I, section 9, to computer searches
will not necessarily be appropriate in other contexts.
Cite as 363 Or 185 (2018) 211

permits police to seize evidence without a warrant if they
are in a place where they have a right to be and have proba-
ble cause to believe that the evidence that they see in “plain
view” is contraband or evidence of a crime. Carter, 342 Or
at 45. A number of courts have considered the application
of the plain view doctrine in computer search cases, and
the cases are divided. Compare United States v. Williams,
592 F3d 511, 521-24 (4th Cir 2010), cert den, 562 US 1044
(2010) (admitting computer search data under plain view
doctrine) with Comprehensive Drug Testing, Inc., 621 F3d
at 1170 (rejecting application of plain view doctrine as “too
clever by half”). Commentators also have expressed differ-
ing views. Compare Kerr, 119 Harv L Rev at 577 (rejecting
plain view in computer search cases) with Thomas K. Clancy,
The Fourth Amendment Aspects of Computer Searches and
Seizures: A perspective and a primer, 75 Miss L J 193, 262
(2005) (approving plain view, citing cases). Moreover, it is
not clear how a doctrine developed in connection with phys-
ical objects, the “incriminating character” of which must be
“mmediately apparent,” Minnesota v. Dickerson, 508 US
366, 375, 113 S Ct 2130, 124 L Ed 2d 334 (1993), would apply
to bits and files digitally stored on a computer hard drive.

We recognize that some of the legal conclusions that
we reach in this case likely would have implications for a
plain view argument, if raised in a computer search case.
However, as noted, the state does not rely on that doctrine
here and neither party has briefed the issue; in these cir-
cumstances, further discussion regarding the application
vel non of that doctrine to computer searches should await a
future case.

3. The particularity requirement as applied to com-
puter searches

Our conclusion that the lawful seizure of defendant’s
computer does not, by itself, permit the state to analyze and
use all of the information found on the computer leaves us
with the task of considering the scope of the warrant and
defendant’s argument that the warrant was impermissibly
overbroad. That task requires us to apply the particularity
requirement of Article I, section 9, to the search of the com-
puter’s contents. We sketch the particularity requirement as
212 State v. Mansor

set out in our prior cases, and then discuss that standard as
it applies here.

A search warrant must “particularly describ[e] the
place to be searched, and the person or thing to be seized.”
Or Const, Art I, § 9. Regarding places, the particularity
requirement exists to “narrow the scope of the search to
those premises for which a magistrate has found probable
cause to authorize the search.” State v. Trax, 335 Or 597,
602, 75 P3d 440 (2003) (quoting State v. Cortman, 251 Or
566, 569, 446 P2d 681 (1968), cert den, 394 US 951 (1969)).
It is satisfied if the warrant “permits the executing officer ‘to
locate with reasonable effort the premises to be searched.”
Trax, 335 Or at 603 (quoting Cortman, 251 Or at 568-69).
We have decided fewer cases that address the particularity
requirement as it applies to the “thing to be seized.” The
doctrine in that area is highly fact dependent and eludes
a single, concrete articulation. See LaFave, 2 Search and
Seizure § 4.6(a) at 769-775 (listing 12 principles as “useful
guideposts” in determining if a description of an item meets
the Fourth Amendment particularity requirement). But the
purposes of the particularity requirement as to things are
the same for the requirement of particularity as to places,
viz.: The warrant must allow the executing officer to identify
with “reasonable effort” the things to be seized “for which
a magistrate has found probable cause.” Trax, 335 Or at
602-03.

Our cases have identified two related, but distinct,
concepts that inform the particularity analysis—specificity
and overbreadth. See Mansor, 279 Or App at 792-802 (dis-
cussing and applying specificity and overbreadth concepts).
A warrant must be sufficiently specific in describing the
items to be seized and examined that the officers can, “with
reasonable effort ascertain” those items to a “reasonable
degree of certainty.” Blackburn/Barber, 266 Or at 35. But,
even if the warrant is sufficiently specific, it must not autho-
rize a search that is “broader than the supporting affidavit
supplies probable cause to justify.” State v. Reid, 319 Or 65,
71, 872 P2d 416 (1994).

The state argues that a warrant is sufficiently
specific and not overbroad—and therefore satisfies the
Cite as 363 Or 185 (2018) 213

particularity requirement—if the warrant identifies the
crime being investigated. It asserts that the warrant here
met that requirement because it referred to the crimes
under investigation at the time the warrant was issued—
criminal mistreatment and assault. Defendant responds
that, for purposes of the search of a computer, the partic-
ularity requirement means that the warrant must identify
(1) “a specific file or type of evidence supported by probable
cause,” (2) “a specific location on [the] computer,” and (3) a
specific time period, consistent with the probable cause jus-
tifying the warrant—essentially, the “what,” the “where,”
and the “when” of the data or information that police have
probable cause to search for on the computer.

Turning first to the state’s argument that the war-
rant here was sufficiently particular because it authorized
the search of the computer for “evidence of a particular
crime,” we disagree. The state suggests that we previously
held in State v. Farrar, 309 Or 132, 149-50, 786 P2d 161,
cert den, 498 US 879 (1990), that a search warrant was suf-
ficiently particular if it referred to the crime under inves-
tigation. The warrants there instructed officers to search
identified locations for a number of specific items and “any
other physical evidence of the aggravated murder of [the vic-
tim].” Id. at 149. We explained that the warrants—and the
phrase “any other physical evidence of the aggravated mur-
der” as a description of the scope of the search—were valid
because former ORS 133.585 (1973), repealed by Or Laws
1997, ch 313, § 37, authorized the seizure of items not spe-
cifically described in a warrant. Jd. at 151. The applicable
statute allowed officers searching a person or place to seize
“things, not specified in the warrant, which the officer has
probable cause to believe to be subject to seizure,” articulat-
ing a version of the “plain view” exception to the warrant
requirement." Jd. (quoting former ORS 133.585(1973)). That
statute applied in the circumstances of that case, the court
explained, because the officers knew the instrumentality of
the crime and several related items that they were looking
for—the murder weapon, stolen jewelry—but did not know

M4 See State v. Reger, 277 Or App 81, 92 n 2, 372 P3d 26, rev den, 359 Or 847
(2016) (describing former ORS 133.585 (1973) as relating to one aspect of plain
view doctrine and explaining repeal of statute).
214 State v. Mansor

if other physical evidence linking the defendant to the crime
might be present in the locations they were authorized to
search. Id.

Farrar thus did not turn on the fact that the war-
rants at issue there identified a particular crime. Rather,
that decision was based on the court’s determinations, first,
that seizing the numerous specific physical items identified
in the warrants (as to which there was probable cause) was
permissible, and, second, that seizing other physical items
related to the charged crime that officers might find in
plain view as they conducted the warranted searches was
permissible under the catch-all provision codified in former
ORS 133.585 (1990). Farrar was a case-specific application
of a statute (later repealed) and essentially upheld a search
based on probable cause as described in a detailed affida-
vit and warrants. This court’s statements in Farrar, quoted
above, are not a blanket endorsement of nonspecific terms
in search warrants and provide no support for the state’s
proposed rule that merely identifying the crime under inves-
tigation provides sufficient particularity to search the entire
contents of a lawfully seized computer.

Defendant’s proposed rules for determining when a
search warrant for a computer is sufficiently particular are
closer to the mark, although not without their own difficul-
ties, which arise primarily because the particularity require-
ment developed in a world of physical evidence rather than
in the digital context described above. We discuss that con-
text and the Delaware Supreme Court’s decision in Wheeler,
and then evaluate defendant’s argument that to meet the
particularity requirement of Article I, section 9, a warrant
to search a computer must identify the “what,” the “where,”
and the “when” of the evidence that police seek.

The unique characteristics of computers, outlined
above, have implications for the application of the partic-
ularity requirement as it applies to computer searches. In
the physical world, “different spatial regions are used for
different purposes,” which allows police and courts to make
probable cause determinations “as to where evidence may or
may not be found.” Orin S. Kerr, Digital Evidence and the
New Criminal Procedure, 105 Colum L Rev 279, 303 (2005).
Cite as 363 Or 185 (2018) 215

Inside computers, however, there is “no way to know ahead
of time where *** a particular file or piece of information
may be located.” Jd. As a result, although the particular-
ity doctrine is an effective means of restraining the state’s
power to search and can protect against general warrants in
the physical world, “the particularity requirement presents
difficult challenges in the context of computer searches.”
Wheeler, 135 A3d at 299 (emphasis omitted; capitalization
corrected); see also Kerr, 48 Tex Tech L Rev at 17 (conclud-
ing that “particularity alone is unlikely to provide sufficient
limits on computer warrant searches”).

In Wheeler, the Delaware Supreme Court reversed
convictions for possession of digital child pornography
because the material was found pursuant to an unconsti-
tutionally overbroad warrant. The warrant authorized an
unrestricted search of a defendant’s computer and other
digital equipment as part of an investigation into the defen-
dant’s alleged witness tampering. 135 A3d at 289. The evi-
dence of the witness tampering was suspected to be a kind
of “text” file, but the examiner did not use an available fea-
ture of the forensic software to limit his view to text-type
files. Id. at 290. Instead, he viewed all file types and found,
but did not open, video files with titles suggesting that they
depicted child pornography. Based on those video files, the
state obtained another search warrant authorizing the
search of digital media already in its possession for evidence
of child pornography, leading to the defendant’s conviction.
Id. at 291.

In holding that the first warrant was not sufficiently
particular, the court stated that the warrant, by purporting
to authorize an unlimited examination of the defendant’s
digital media, paved the way for “unconstitutional explor-
atory rummaging.” Id. at 305. Notably, the court did not rest
its invalidation of the warrant on the executing officer’s fail-
ure to exclude nontext video files from the examination—as
discussed above, such court-prescribed “search protocols”
are, in the majority view, unworkable. Rather, the war-
rant was unconstitutionally overbroad because it “fail[ed]
to limit the search to the relevant time frame.” Id. at 304.
Some federal and state courts have held that a warrant for
a computer search is insufficiently particular if it does not
216 State v. Mansor

include a temporal description of the evidence sought, in
cases where relevant time information is available to the
police. Jd. at 304 n 117, 305 n 118 (citing cases). In addition,
the warrant expressly authorized the seizure and examina-
tion of all digital equipment, including video DVDs and digi-
tal cameras, despite the absence of any indication that those
objects would contain textual evidence of witness tamper-
ing. Id. at 306. In all, the court declined to “prescribe rigid
rules” governing the application of the particularity require-
ment in computer search contexts; rather, it concluded that
a warrant “must describe what investigating officers believe
will be found on electronic devices with as much specificity
as possible under the circumstances.” Id. at 304.

We return to the components of defendant’s pro-
posed rule. Following Wheeler—and, indeed, general princi-
ples of search and seizure law—we agree that to satisfy the
particularity requirement, a warrant must describe, with
as much specificity as reasonably possible under the circum-
stances, what investigating officers believe will be found on
the electronic devices. See id. Defendant clarifies that that
element does not necessarily mean the type of computer file,
such as an email, text, or photograph. Rather, for the reasons
discussed above regarding the nature of digital evidence,
the “what” is a description of the information related to the
alleged criminal conduct which there is probable cause to
believe will be found on the computer. Given the protean
variety of factual settings in which such warrants are likely
to be sought, it would be a fool’s errand to set out, in the
abstract, detailed guidelines for determining how specific
the “what” of the search must be to meet the particularity
requirement of Article I, section 9, in the computer search
context, and we decline to do so.

Defendant also argues that, to be sufficiently par-
ticular, a warrant authorizing a computer search must iden-
tify “where” the search may be conducted on the computer.
Defendant contends that any search must be limited to “the
place or specific location in the computer where the evi-
dence is likely to be found without much effort or rummag-
ing—in this case, defendant’s ‘internet browsing history.”
Defendant suggests that locations on a computer hard drive
are like rooms in a house, and that the warrant must limit
Cite as 363 Or 185 (2018) 217

the search to specified rooms, such as “internet browsing
history, document files, hard drive, emails, call logs, and
varying application folders.” We disagree.

It is certainly true that many warrants authoriz-
ing computer searches will identify commonly used soft-
ware programs—email clients, internet browsers, document
management tools—where relevant evidence is likely to be
found. For the practical reasons explained above, however,
a search warrant may be sufficiently particular without
being limited to searching in those “places.” Imposing such
limits on a computer search would require police and the
reviewing magistrate to know the technological specifica-
tions, including the configuration of the operating system
and applications software on a computer, before a warrant
could be obtained. Limiting a search to certain “places” on a
computer, defined in terms of the computer’s internal orga-
nization, such as the “My Documents” folder, is an ex ante
limitation on the search. Such ex ante limitations would
require a valid warrant to be based on more detailed knowl-
edge of a specific computer and its software than would be
required to meet the usual probable cause standard for the
information being sought. And defining “places” on a com-
puter in terms of a person’s particular use of them, such as
“places where a user may store documents,” is essentially
redundant of the “what” element discussed above. Moreover,
information on a computer easily can be moved from one vir-
tual location to another, either intentionally or by mistake.
We do not think that it is useful to conceive of a computer
as consisting of multiple “rooms” or containers, and a valid
warrant to search a computer need not identify “places” to
search at that level of abstraction.

Defendant also argues that a warrant for a com-
puter search should include a “temporal limitation” or
“when” requirement, if one is available and relevant. In
Wheeler, the court held that the warrant was unconsti-
tutionally broad because, among other things, it failed to
“limit the search to the relevant time frame.” 135 A3d at
304. In reaching that conclusion, the court noted that fed-
eral and state courts have concluded that “warrants lacking
temporal constraints, where relevant dates are available to
the police, are insufficiently particular.” Id. at 304 n 117, 305
218 State v. Mansor

n 118 (listing cases). Certainly, consideration of the time
when relevant documents were created or internet sites vis-
ited can be helpful in ensuring that the warrant describes
that which the executing officers may search for with suf-
ficient specificity, but without impermissible overbreadth.
And we agree with the reasoning in Wheeler and the cases
cited there that when a time-based description of the infor-
mation sought on a computer is relevant and available to the
police, it ordinarily should be set out in the affidavit, and the
warrant should include that description. That said, analyt-
ically, “temporal limitations” are more accurately seen as a
way of identifying with greater specificity the “what” that is
being searched for, rather than as a separate, independently
required element, in meeting the particularity requirement
for a computer search.

We thus agree in substantial part with defendant.
The warrant to search a computer must be based on affida-
vits that establish probable cause to believe that the com-
puter contains information relevant to the criminal inves-
tigation. To meet the particularity requirement of Article I,
section 9, the warrant must identify, as specifically as rea-
sonably possible in the circumstances, the information to be
searched for, including, if relevant and available, the time
period during which that information was created, accessed,
or otherwise used. We emphasize, however, based on our dis-
cussion of digital devices and computer searches above, see
363 Or at __, that the forensic examination likely will need
to examine, at least briefly, some information or data beyond
that identified in the warrant."

4. Was the warrant here sufficiently particular?

Returning to the facts of this case, the affida-
vit established probable cause to believe that child abuse
was the cause of B’s injuries and probable cause to believe
that evidence related to the crime would be found on the
computer. When Rookhuyzen interviewed defendant in his
apartment, defendant was “completely non-emotive” and
had not called his wife, behavior that Rookhuyzen called

45 To be clear, although a computer search may need to be broad, it must be
reasonably executed. Or Const, Art I, § 9 (protecting right to be free from “unrea-
sonable search, or seizure”).
Cite as 363 Or 185 (2018) 219

“highly” and “extremely” unusual. Based on defendant’s
statements regarding his searches shortly before the 9-1-1
call, there also was probable cause to believe that one or
more of the computers at the apartment contained informa-
tion that would confirm or refute defendant’s statements
about what happened in the minutes before that call:

“([Defendant] told [Rookhuyzen] that he searched the inter-
net between the time he noticed [B] was having difficulty
breathing and the time he called emergency dispatch. He
told [Rookhuyzen] that he was using a computer to search
the internet for advice on what he should do.”

Additionally, the affidavit recited statements of the pediatri-
cian who examined B that B’s injuries were “clearly the result
of intentionally inflicted abuse” and that “[defendant’s] ver-
sion of events was not consistent with [B]’s condition”; that
B had a brain injury “unrelated to choking”; and that B had
a recent skull fracture and bilateral retinal hemorrhages.
Finally, the affidavit stated Rookhuyzen’s view, based on his
training and experience, that computers retain a history of
internet use and that examination of a computer needs to be
done in a forensic laboratory.

The affidavit thus established probable cause to
believe that a crime had occurred on June 12 and explained,
based on case-specific facts and the officer’s training and
experience, that there was probable cause to believe that
evidence relevant to the investigation would be found on the
computer. The affidavit described with particularity certain
evidence likely to be found on the computer. Indeed, as the
Court of Appeals noted, defendant twice conceded at the
suppression hearing “the lawfulness of a search of the com-
puters with respect to the 15 minutes preceding the 9-1-1
call.” Mansor, 279 Or App at 791.

The warrant, read in conjunction with and lim-
ited by the affidavit, met the particularity requirement of
Article I, section 9, as we have articulated it above. It suffi-
ciently described the “what” to be searched for and the rel-
evant time frame: The June 12 internet search history. It
informed those executing the warrant as to what they were to
look for “with a reasonable degree of certainty.” Blackburn/
Barber, 266 Or at 35. And, because that description limited
220 State v. Mansor

the extent of the search that was authorized by the warrant,
as we read it, the permitted search was not “broader than
the supporting affidavit supplie[d] probable cause to justify.”
Reid, 319 Or at 71. For that reason, although we agree with
much of the Court of Appeals’ learned analysis, we disagree
with its legal conclusion that the warrant was overbroad on
its face and therefore invalid in toto. In our view, the war-
rant was not facially invalid because it authorized a search
for only the June 12 internet history.

V. USE OF RESULTS OF COMPUTER SEARCHES

It does not follow, however, that the trial court
was correct in denying defendant’s motion to suppress the
results of the forensic examination in their entirety. As we
have discussed, the warrant authorized a search only for
the June 12 internet search history. That search was sup-
ported by probable cause, was sufficiently specific, and was
not overbroad. The nature of a computer search, however,
means that, in searching for that history, that the forensic
examiners were likely to come across or discover additional
information. And, in this case, the forensic examination
searched for and uncovered information, later used at trial,
that went far beyond the scope of the warrant.

To ensure the protection of Article I, section 9,
rights, we must consider what restrictions, if any, should be
imposed on the use of information police obtain through rea-
sonably executed warranted computer searches when those
searches uncover evidence beyond that authorized in the
warrant, and when no exception to the warrant requirement
supports the collection or use of that evidence.

In our view, the privacy interests underlying
Article I, section 9, are best protected by recognizing a nec-
essary trade-off when the state searches a computer that
has been lawfully seized. Even a reasonable search autho-
rized by a valid warrant necessarily may require examina-
tion of at least some information that is beyond the scope
of the warrant. Such state searches raise the possibility of
computer search warrants becoming the digital equivalent
of general warrants and of sanctioning the “undue rum-
maging that the particularity requirement was enacted to
preclude.” Mansor, 279 Or App at 803 (internal quotation
Cite as 363 Or 185 (2018) 221

marks omitted). Although such searches are lawful and
appropriate, individual privacy interests preclude the state
from benefiting from that necessity by being permitted to
use that evidence at trial. We thus conclude that the state
should not be permitted to use information obtained in a
computer search if the warrant did not authorize the search
for that information, unless some other warrant exception
applies. See Kerr, 48 Tex Tech L Rev at 24 (suggesting use
restrictions for data “nonresponsive” to the warrant). Put
differently, when the state conducts a reasonably targeted
search of a person’s computer for information pursuant to
a warrant that properly identifies the information being
sought, the state has not unreasonably invaded the person’s
privacy interest, and the state may use the information
identified in the warrant in a prosecution or any other law-
ful manner. But when the state looks for other information
or uncovers information that was not authorized by the war-
rant, Article I, section 9, prohibits the state from using that
information at trial, unless it comes within an exception to
the warrant requirement.

That approach is consistent with our explanation
that the purpose of rules requiring the suppression of evi-
dence gathered in violation of the constitution is to restore
the parties to the position they would have been in had the
violation not occurred:

“(Rules of law designed to protect citizens against unau-
thorized or illegal searches or seizures of their persons,
property, or private effects are to be given effect by denying
the state the use of evidence secured in violation of those
rules against the persons whose rights were violated, or,
in effect, by restoring the parties to their position as if
the state’s officers had remained within the limits of their
authority.”

State v. Davis, 295 Or 227, 237, 666 P2d 802 (1983). Here, the
warrant authorized the police to search for specific informa-
tion on defendant’s computer—the June 12 internet search
history. The state properly searched for and found that evi-
dence and used it at trial. But the state also searched for
and obtained, and used at trial, a substantial amount of evi-
dence from the computer that was not within the scope of
the warrant. We have rejected the state’s arguments that
222 State v. Mansor

the warrant authorized the seizure of that additional evi-
dence, and the state has identified no exception to the war-
rant requirement that supported its acquisition, and use, of
that evidence. To restore defendant to the position he would
have been in had the police not obtained that additional evi-
dence, the evidence other than the June 12 internet search
history should have been suppressed.

VI. CONCLUSION

In summary: Article I, section 9, prohibits general
warrants that give “the bearer an unlimited authority to
search and seize.” Carter, 342 Or at 43 (quoting Reid, 319 Or
at 69). Instead, subject to certain exceptions, that provision
requires a warrant based on probable cause and describ-
ing with particularity that which the state may search for
and seize. As the Supreme Court explained in Riley, digital
information on cell phones—and, by logical extension, com-
puters and similar digital devices—implicates privacy inter-
ests entitled to constitutional protection under the Fourth
Amendment, and those interests are equal to or surpass
those of a home. 134 S Ct at 2491. The Court’s reasoning
is persuasive and informs our understanding of the proper
application of the Oregon warrant requirement to searches
of computers and other digital devices.

As explained above, we reject the state’s initial
argument that a computer is like any other “thing” and that,
if it is lawfully seized pursuant to a warrant or is other-
wise lawfully in the state’s possession, any information that
is discovered on the computer is also lawfully seized and
can be used at trial. We also reject the state’s alternative
argument that a warrant to seize and search a computer
is sufficiently particular if it simply identifies the crime
or crimes being investigated. We instead conclude that, to
meet the particularity requirement of Article I, section 9, a
warrant to search for and seize a computer—and to search
the computer itself for information related to a crime—must
be based on probable cause to believe that such evidence will
be found on the computer and must describe the informa-
tion the state seeks (the “what”) with as much specificity as
reasonably possible under the circumstances, including, if
available and relevant, a temporal description of when the
Cite as 363 Or 185 (2018) 223

information was created, accessed, or otherwise used. As
a practical matter, a forensic examination of the computer
that reasonably seeks to discover the evidence described in
the warrant may reveal evidence that is beyond the scope
of the warrant. We also hold that, because of the possibility
that a computer search will uncover information that is not
authorized by the warrant, a defendant’s Article I, section
9, privacy rights prevent the state from using such infor-
mation unless it comes within an exception to the warrant
requirement.

In this case, the trial court denied defendant’s
motion to suppress the “material discovered as the result
of a warranted search of his home computers.” Mansor,
279 Or App at 779. The Court of Appeals reversed, hold-
ing that the warrant was impermissibly overbroad and that
the trial court should have granted the motion to suppress.
Id. at 802. As discussed at length above, we conclude that the
warrant, as limited by the affidavit, was not facially invalid,
because the accompanying affidavit established probable
cause to search the computers and specifically identified the
information to be sought. However, the warrant, as limited
by the affidavit, did not authorize police to search for and
recover much of the other voluminous material that was
contained in the computer and that also was subject to the
motion to suppress. The trial court’s decision denying the
motion to suppress and allowing the evidence beyond the
scope of the warrant to be used at trial was erroneous. That
error was not harmless. We therefore reverse and remand to
the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.

The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
The judgment of the circuit court is reversed, and the case
is remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings.
