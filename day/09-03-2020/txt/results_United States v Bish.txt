in favor of the non-moving party. Boucher,
880 F.3d at 365. In this case, it appears
that the district court drew at least one
inference against the non-moving party.

But any error was harmless. First, the
district court had already stepped through
the correct contractual analysis and made
its conclusion before any discussion of in-
ferences to draw from the parties’ behav-
ior after the incident had occurred. Sec-
ond, and more importantly, even if we
were to draw the opposite inference in
Vesuvius’s favor, it would make no differ-
ence. We might infer that Vesuvius genu-
inely believed that it had complied in full
with its obligations under {1 22 by notifying
ACBL of the problem on February 20,
2015. Vesuvius might then have genuinely
believed that it had all the time in the
world to bring suit, and it did so two years
later. But because we find that the con-
tract is not ambiguous, the parties’ actions
after they signed the contract are irrele-
vant to the meaning of the contract itself.
Regardless of whether we were to infer
from Vesuvius’s actions that it genuinely
believed its own position or whether it
knew that its suit was untimely, the mean-
ing of the contract is the same.

III. Conciusion

Standing on its own, perhaps the limita-
tions provision of the contract might be
ambiguous. But read in context with the
rest of the contract, there is no question
that Vesuvius was required to file suit no
later than four months after it discovered
the damage. Because Vesuvius waited two
years to bring its claim, the district court
properly dismissed it as untimely. Accord-
ingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the
district court.

UNITED STATES of America,
Plaintiff-Appellee,

v.
Edward BISHOP, Defendant-Appellant.
No. 18-2019

United States Court of Appeals,
Seventh Circuit.

Argued November 14, 2018
Decided December 7, 2018

Background: Defendant was charged
with discharging firearm during drug
transaction. The United States District
Court for the Northern District of Indiana,
No. 3:17-er-55 RLM-MGG, Robert L. Mil-
ler, Jr., J., denied defendant’s motion to
suppress evidence obtained during search
of his cell phone, and, after jury convicted
him, 2018 WL 1616892, denied his motion
for new trial. Defendant appealed.

Holding: The Court of Appeals, Easter-
brook, Circuit Judge, held that search war-
rant satisfied Fourth Amendment’s partic-
ularity requirement.

Affirmed.

1. Controlled Substances 147

With respect to the Fourth Amend-
ment’s particularity requirement, a war-
rant authorizing a search of a house for
drugs permits the police to search every-
where in the house, because “everywhere”
is where the contraband may be hidden.
U.S. Const. Amend. 4.

2. Searches and Seizures <148

With respect to the Fourth Amend-
ment’s particularity requirement, a war-
rant authorizing a search for documents
that will prove a crime may authorize a
search of every document the suspect has,
336

because any of them might supply evi-
dence. U.S. Const. Amend. 4.

3. Searches and Seizures 125

Search warrant, which permitted
search of every document on defendant’s
cell phone, satisfied Fourth Amendment’s
particularity requirement; warrant stated
the crimes under investigation, i.e., crimi-
nal recklessness with deadly weapon and
drug dealing, and police did not know
where defendant kept his drug ledgers and
gun videos until they searched the phone.
U.S. Const. Amend. 4.

4, Searches and Seizures 125

With respect to the Fourth Amend-
ment’s particularity requirement, it is
enough if the warrant cabins the things
being looked for by stating what crime is
under investigation. U.S. Const. Amend.
4,

5. Searches and Seizures ¢-124

With respect to the Fourth Amend-
ment’s particularity requirement, a war-
rant may be thought too general only if
some more-specific alternative would have
done better at protecting privacy while
still permitting legitimate investigation.
U.S. Const. Amend. 4.

Before EASTERBROOK, SYKES, and
SCUDDER, Circuit Judges.

910 FEDERAL REPORTER, 3d SERIES

EASTERBROOK, Circuit Judge.

A drug deal went wrong. After receiving
a dose of pepper spray from his customer,
Edward Bishop shot her in the arm. A
jury convicted him of discharging a fire-
arm during a drug transaction, 18 U.S.C.
§ 924(c), and the judge sentenced him to
120 months’ imprisonment. He presents
one contention on appeal: that the warrant
authorizing a search of his cell phone—a
search that turned up incriminating evi-
dence—violated the Fourth Amendment’s
requirement that every warrant “particu-
larly describ[e] the place to be searched,
and the persons or things to be seized.”

This warrant described the “place to be
searched” as the cell phone Bishop carried
during the attempted sale, and it described
the things to be seized as:

any evidence (including all photos, vid-

eos, and/or any other digital files, includ-

ing removable memory cards) of suspect
identity, motive, scheme/plan along with

DNA evidence of the crime of Criminal

Recklessness with a deadly weapon

which is hidden or secreted [in the cell-

phone or] related to the offense of Deal-

ing illegal drugs.
That is too general, Bishop asserts, be-
cause it authorized the police to rummage
through every application and file on the
phone and left to the officers’ judgment
the decision which files met the descrip-
tion. The district court found the warrant
valid, however, and denied the motion to
suppress.

[1,2] Bishop is right about the facts.
This warrant does permit the police to look
at every file on his phone and decide which
files satisfy the description. But he is
wrong to think that this makes a warrant
too general. Criminals don’t advertise
where they keep evidence. A warrant au-
thorizing a search of a house for drugs
permits the police to search everywhere in
the house, because “everywhere” is where
US. v. BISHOP

the contraband may be hidden. United
States v. Ross, 456 U.S. 798, 820-21, 102
S.Ct. 2157, 72 L.Ed.2d 572 (1982); Steele v.
United States, 267 U.S. 498, 503, 45 S.Ct.
414, 69 L.Ed. 757 (1925). And a warrant
authorizing a search for documents that
will prove a crime may authorize a search
of every document the suspect has, be-
cause any of them might supply evidence.
To see this, it isn’t necessary to look be-
yond Andresen v. Maryland, 427 U.S. 463,
96 S.Ct. 2737, 49 L.Ed.2d 627 (1976), in
which the Court considered a warrant that
permitted a search of every document in a
lawyer's files. Agents were authorized to
search for:

title notes, title abstracts, title run-
downs; contracts of sale and/or assign-
ments from Raffaele Antonelli and
Rocco Caniglia to Mount Vernon De-
velopment Corporation and/or others;
lien payoff correspondence and _ lien
pay-off memoranda to and from lien-
holders and noteholders; correspon-
dence and memoranda to and from
trustees of deeds of trust; lenders in-
structions for a construction loan or
construction and permanent loan; dis-
bursement sheets and disbursement
memoranda; checks, check stubs and
ledger sheets indicating disbursement
upon settlement; correspondence and
memoranda concerning disbursements
upon settlement; settlement statements
and settlement memoranda; fully or
partially prepared deed of trust releas-
es, whether or not executed and
whether or not recorded; books, rec-
ords, documents, papers, memoranda
and correspondence, showing or tend-
ing to show a fraudulent intent, and/or
knowledge as elements of the crime of
false pretenses, in violation of Article
27, Section 140, of the Annotated Code
of Maryland, 1957 Edition, as amended
and revised, together with other fruits,

instrumentalities and evidence of

crime at this [time] unknown.
427 U.S. at 480-81 n.10, 96 S.Ct. 2737
(emphasis added). Andresen accepted the
propriety of looking at every document in
his possession but maintained that the ital-
icized phrase entitled the agents to seize
anything they wanted. The Justices con-
cluded, however, that, when read in con-
text, the contested language did no more
than permit the seizure of any other evi-
dence pertaining to real-estate fraud, the
subject of the warrant. Id. at 479-82, 96
S.Ct. 2737.

[3,4] Just so with this warrant. It per-
mits the search of every document on the
cell phone, which (like a computer) serves
the same function as the filing cabinets in
Andresen’s office. See Riley v. California,
573 U.S. 373, 134 S.Ct. 2473, 2489, 189
L.Ed.2d 430 (2014). And as with filing
cabinets, the incriminating evidence may
be in any file or folder. That’s why courts
routinely conclude that warrants with
wording similar to the one at issue here
are valid. See, eg., Archer v. Chisholm,
870 F.3d 603, 616 (7th Cir. 2017); United
States v. Hall, 142 F.3d 988, 996-97 (7th
Cir. 1998); Wayne R. LaFave, 2 Search &
Seizure § 4.6(d) (5th ed. 2012 & Supp.
2018) (citing many other cases). It is
enough, these decisions hold, if the war-
rant cabins the things being looked for by
stating what crime is under investigation.

[5] Andresen and its successors show
that specificity is a relative matter. A war-
rant may be thought “too general” only if
some more-specific alternative would have
done better at protecting privacy while
still permitting legitimate investigation.
See United States v. Vitek Supply Corp.,
144 F.3d 476, 482 (7th Cir. 1998); United
States v. Bentley, 825 F.2d 1104, 1110 (7th
Cir. 1987). So if the police had known that
Andresen kept all of his files about the
real-estate deal in a particular cabinet, fail-
338

ure to identify that cabinet in the warrant
would have violated the constitutional par-
ticularity requirement. But a warrant need
not be more specific than knowledge al-
lows. In Andresen the police did not know
how the target organized his files, so the
best they could do was the broad language
the warrant used. Likewise here: the po-
lice did not know where on his phone
Bishop kept his drug ledgers and gun vid-
eos—and, if he had told them, they would
have been fools to believe him, for crimi-
nals often try to throw investigators off
the trail. This warrant was as specific as
circumstances allowed. The Constitution
does not require more.

United States Court of Appeals,

Argued October 24, 2018
Decided December 7, 2018

Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc
Denied January 17, 2019

Background: Debtor brought action
against debt collector, alleging that debt
collector set misleading debt collection let-
ter in violation of Fair Debt Collection
Practices Act (FDCPA). The United States
District Court for the Eastern District of
Wisconsin, No. 17-C-0957, Lynn Adelman,
J., granted debt collector’s motion to dis-
miss for failure to state claim, and subse-
quently, 2018 WL 1709412, denied debtor’s

910 FEDERAL REPORTER, 3d SERIES

motion for reconsideration. Debtor appeal-
ed.

Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Manion,
Circuit Judge, held that:

(1) debt collector’s placement of validation
notice on second page of debt collection
letter did not overshadow notice, and

(2) district court did not abuse its discre-
tion in denying debtor leave to amend
her complaint to add new claims on
grounds of undue delay and prejudice.

Affirmed.

1. Federal Courts <3587(1), 3667

The Court of Appeals reviews de novo
the dismissal of a complaint for failure to
state a claim, accepting the plaintiffs fac-
tual allegations as true and drawing all
permissible inferences in her favor.

2. Federal Civil Procedure €=1772

To survive a motion to dismiss for
failure to state a claim, a plaintiff must
allege enough facts to state a claim to
relief that is plausible on its face.

3. Federal Civil Procedure <=1831

Whether a debt-collection letter is
confusing in violation of the Fair Debt
Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) is gen-
erally a fact question that, if well pleaded,
survives a motion to dismiss for failure to
state a claim. Consumer Credit Protec-
tion Act § 807, 15 U.S.C.A. § 1692e.

4. Finance, Banking, and Credit <=1482

If it is apparent from a reading of the
debt collection letter that not even a signif-
icant fraction of the population would be
misled by it, then the plaintiff fails to state
a claim under the Fair Debt Collection
Practices Act (FDCPA) and dismissal is
appropriate. Consumer Credit Protection
Act § 807, 15 U.S.C.A. § 1692e.
