fees as sanctions for his contempt. At the
hearing, an affidavit of Angela’s attorney
setting forth her attorney fees in this mat-
ter was admitted without objection. Hav-
ing determined that Russell willfully failed
to abide by the parties’ Agreement, there-
by causing Angela to file a motion for rule
to show cause and incur attorney fees, we
find the trial court did not abuse its discre-
tion in ordering Russell to pay $3,000.00 of
Angela’s attorney fees.

[16] [21] For the reasons stated, we
conclude the action of reinstating Angela
as beneficiary of Russell’s SBP as ordered
by the trial court cannot be accomplished
under the applicable federal law; therefore,
we reverse and remand with instructions
for the trial court to fashion an appropri-
ate remedy to compensate Angela for the
loss of her portion of Russell’s SBP. In
addition, we affirm the trial court’s finding
of contempt against Russell and its imposi-
tion of sanctions for such.

Kevin Shawn CARTER, Appellant-
Defendant,

v.
STATE of Indiana, Appellee—Plaintiff.
Court of Appeals Case
No. 17A-CR-3024
Court of Appeals of Indiana.

Filed June 28, 2018
Background: Defendant was convicted in
the Circuit Court, Vanderburgh County,
Kelli E. Fink, Magistrate, of dealing in a
narcotic drug, and dealing in methamphet-
amine. Defendant appealed.

Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Bailey,

J., held that:

(1) affidavit provided a substantial basis
for determining that probable cause
existed to support search warrant of
defendant's cell phone;

(2) warrant allowing law enforcement to
search defendant’s cell phone for any
information relating to calls and mes-
sages was tailored to its justifications;

(3) law enforcement’s use of an extraction
device that created an auto generated
report of the file architecture on defen-
dant’s cell phone did not render the
search warrant defectively unparticu-
larized;

(4) challenged text messages were proper-
ly seized under the search warrant;
and

(5) the search of defendant’s cell phone for
evidence of drug dealing activities was
reasonable under the totality of the
circumstances.

Affirmed.

1. Criminal Law 661
The trial court has broad discretion to
rule on the admissibility of evidence.

2. Criminal Law 1153.1

Ordinarily, an appellate court reviews
evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discre-
tion, evaluating whether the court’s ruling
was clearly against the logic and effect of
the facts and circumstances.

3. Criminal Law ¢-1139

When a challenge of an evidentiary
ruling is predicated on the constitutionality
of the search or seizure of evidence, it
raises a question of law that an appellate
court reviews de novo.

Under the Fourth Amendment, rea-
sonableness generally requires the obtain-

ing of a judicial warrant. U.S. Const.
Amend. 4; Ind. Const. art. 1, § 11.

5. Arrest €=71.1(1, 4.1)

Among the exceptions to the warrant
requirement is a search incident to a law-
ful arrest, whereby the Fourth Amend-
ment permits a warrantless search of the
arrestee’s person and the area within his
immediate control. U.S. Const. Amend. 4;
Ind. Const. art. 1, § 11.

6. Arrest 71.1(5)

Under the search incident to a lawful
arrest exception to the warrant require-
ment, officers generally may search the
containers they encounter. U.S. Const.
Amend. 4; Ind. Const. art. 1, § 11.

7. Searches and Seizures 40.1

Probable cause is a fluid concept in-
capable of precise definition and is to be
decided based on the facts of each case.
U.S. Const. Amend. 4; Ind. Const. art. 1,
§ 11.

8. Searches and Seizures ¢=113.1

In determining whether a police affi-
davit sets forth probable cause to issue a
search warrant, the task of the issuing
magistrate is simply to make a practical,
common-sense decision whether, given all
the circumstances set forth in the affidavit
there is a fair probability that contraband
or evidence of a crime will be found in a
particular place. U.S. Const. Amend. 4;
Ind. Const. art. 1, § 11; Ind. Code Ann.
§ 35-33-5-2.

9. Searches and Seizures 113.1

The central question in a probable
cause determination is whether the affida-
vit presents facts, together with reason-
able inferences, demonstrating a sufficient
nexus between the suspected criminal ac-
tivity and the specific place to be searched.
U.S. Const. Amend. 4; Ind. Const. art. 1,

10. Searches and Seizures <=200

Upon a challenge to whether probable
cause supported the issuance of a search

ble cause existed. U.S. Const. Amend. 4;
Ind. Const. art. 1, § 11; Ind. Code Ann.
§ 35-33-5-2.

11. Searches and Seizures <=200

On a challenge to whether probable
cause supported the issuance of a search

when reasonable inferences drawn from
the totality of the evidence support the
determination of probable cause. U.S.
Const. Amend. 4; Ind. Const. art. 1, § 11;
Ind. Code Ann. § 35-33-5-2.

Appellate courts review de novo
whether a substantial basis supported the
determination of probable cause, while af-
fording deference to the magistrate’s deci-
sion to issue the warrant. U.S. Const.
Amend. 4; Ind. Const. art. 1, § 11; Ind.
Code Ann. § 35-33-5-2.

inside defendant’s co-owned vehicle that
contained a substance field-tested to be
methamphetamine, with a field weight of

heroin consistent with drug dealing, that
the phone was recovered from the defen-
dant, and that those involved in drug activ-
ity primarily used cell phones and elec-
tronic devices to communicate with one
another through calls, text messages, and
social media applications. U.S. Const.
Amend. 4; Ind. Const. art. 1, § 11; Ind.
Code Ann. § 35-33-5-2.

14. Searches and Seizures 124

The particularity requirement, that a
warrant must contain a particular descrip-
tion of the place to be searched and the
person or things to be seized, ensures that
the search will be carefully tailored to its
justifications, and will not take on the
character of the wide-ranging exploratory
searches the framers intended to prohibit.
U.S. Const. Amend. 4; Ind. Const. art. 1,
§ 11.

15. Searches and Seizures €>125, 126

Although the warrant must describe
with some specificity where officers are to
search and what they are to seize, there is
no requirement that there be an exact
description. U.S. Const. Amend. 4; Ind.
Const. art. 1, § 11.

16. Searches and Seizures <125, 126

The warrant must be specific enough
so that officers can, with reasonable effort,
ascertain the place to be searched and the
items to be seized. U.S. Const. Amend. 4;
Ind. Const. art. 1, § 11.

17. Searches and Seizures <> 125, 126

The requirement that a warrant must
contain a particular description of the
place to be searched and the persons or
things to be seized prevents the seizure of
one thing under a warrant describing an-
other. U.S. Const. Amend. 4; Ind. Const.
art.1, § 11.

18. Searches and Seizures 125
As to what is to be taken during a
search, nothing is left to the discretion of

the officer executing the warrant. U.S.
Const. Amend. 4; Ind. Const. art. 1, § 11.

19. Searches and Seizures <=124

The description in a search warrant
should be as particular as circumstances
permit. U.S. Const. Amend. 4; Ind. Const.
art. 1, § 11.

20. Searches and Seizures €125

To satisfy the particularity require-
ment of a search warrant, it is permissible
if a warrant incorporates by reference cer-
tain supporting documents, such as the
probable cause affidavit, that collectively
serve to identify the scope of items that
could properly be seized. U.S. Const.
Amend. 4; Ind. Const. art. 1, § 11.

21. Searches and Seizures €125

Warrant allowing law enforcement to
search defendant’s cell phone for any in-
formation relating to calls and messages,
including social media messages and ac-
counts, was tailored to its justifications
that defendant was a suspected drug deal-
er; drug dealers used cell phones to com-
municate with others involved in illicit
drug activity. U.S. Const. Amend. 4; Ind.
Const. art. 1, § 11.

22. Searches and Seizures 125

Law enforcement’s use of an extrac-
tion device that created an auto generated
report of the file architecture on defen-
dant’s cell phone did not render the search
warrant for evidence of drug dealing activ-
ity on defendant’s phone defectively unpar-
ticularized, although more than one thou-
sand pages of information was extracted,
where the law enforcement did not have
the ability to determine that certain pages
did not contain any information sought,
and a great deal of other information likely
had to be sifted through in order to find
the relevant information. U.S. Const.
Amend. 4; Ind. Const. art. 1, § 11.
1124 Ind.

23. Criminal Law ¢=392.61

The infirmity in a search warrant for
not being particularized requires only sup-
pression of the evidence seized pursuant to
that part of the warrant but not the sup-
pression of the evidence obtained pursuant
to the valid specific portions of the war-
rant. U.S. Const. Amend. 4; Ind. Const.
art. 1, § 11.

24. Searches and Seizures 7125

Challenged text messages were prop-
erly seized under the search warrant even
if the portion of the search warrant allow-
ing law enforcement to search phone for
all indicia of ownership of the phone was
insufficiently particular, where the search
warrant also validly allowed law enforce-
ment to search any text messages for evi-
dence of drug activities. U.S. Const.
Amend. 4; Ind. Const. art. 1, § 11.

25. Searches and Seizures <=23

Under the Indiana Constitution, the
legality of a search turns on an evaluation
of the reasonableness of the police conduct
under the totality of the circumstances.
Ind. Const. art. 1, § 11.

26. Searches and Seizures €=23

In evaluating the reasonableness of a
search under the Indiana Constitution, an
appellate court balances three factors: (1)
the degree of suspicion of unlawful activi-
ty, (2) the degree of intrusion the method
of the search imposes on the citizen’s ordi-
nary activities, and (8) the extent of law
enforcement needs. Ind. Const. art. 1,
§ 11.

27. Searches and Seizures 53.1

On balance, the search of defendant’s
cell phone for evidence of drug dealing
activities was reasonable under the totality
of the circumstances; search was intrusive
in nature, as it involved searching a per-
sonal cell phone, but law enforcement had
a high degree of suspicion of unlawful ac-
tivity after locating contraband in defen-
dant’s vehicle, specifically, a quantity of

105 NORTH EASTERN REPORTER, 3d SERIES

methamphetamine with a street value
around $20,000 and a quantity of heroin
with a street value between $9,000 and
$12,000, and searching the phone advanced
law enforcement needs related to identify-
ing drug-dealing activity and protecting
the community from the hazards of meth-
amphetamine and heroin. Ind. Const. art.
1,§ 11.

28. Criminal Law <~1036.6, 1043(1)

Defendant failed to preserve for re-
view the claim that the trial court abused
its discretion by admitting testimony of
detective who opined that the quantity of
heroin seized was typical of a dealer,
where the record indicated that no objec-
tion was made at the time the evidence
was admitted, and it did not appear that
the trial court entered a continuing objec-
tion that would have preserved the issue.

29. Criminal Law €1137(5)

Defendant waived any fundamental-
error argument for trial court’s admission
of testimony of detective who opined that
the quantity of heroin seized was typical of
a dealer amount, where defendant declined
to argue fundamental error, despite having
the opportunity to do so.

Case Summary

[1] A jury convicted Kevin Shawn Carter
(“Carter”) of Dealing in a Narcotic Drug,
as a Level 2 felony,! and Dealing in Meth-
amphetamine, as a Level 2 felony.” There-
after, Carter admitted to being a habitual
offender.* Carter now appeals.

[2] We affirm.
Issues

[3] Carter presents the following two

restated issues:

I. Whether the trial court abused its
discretion by admitting evidence ob-
tained from a search of a cell phone
because the underlying warrant was
impermissibly general, allowing an ex-
ploratory search; and

II. Whether the trial court committed
fundamental error by admitting testi-
mony from an officer who opined that
the amount of heroin seized was a
dealer-level quantity.

Facts and Procedural History ‘

[4] After seeing a Ford Mustang cross
the center line several times, Deputy
Brandon Mattingly (“Deputy Mattingly”)

1. Ind. Code § 35-48-4-1(a)(2), -1(e)(1).
2. LC. § 35-48-4-1.1(a)(2), -1.1(e)(1).

3. LC. § 35-50-2-8.

of the Vanderburgh County Sheriff's De-
partment conducted a traffic stop. Deputy
Mattingly approached the vehicle and ob-
served the front passenger—Carter—mak-
ing furtive movements and appearing to
place an item under his seat. Deputy Mat-
tingly then spoke with the driver, Tiffani
Colschen (“Colschen”). At some point, Car-
ter stated that he co-owned the vehicle,
and both Colschen and Carter consented
to a vehicle search. During the ensuing
search, Deputy Mattingly found a bag be-
tween the front seats. Inside, there was a
container holding a syringe and a spoon.
Below the container there were several
plastic bags that appeared to contain
drugs; subsequent lab testing revealed
that the bags contained, in the aggregate,
approximately 205 grams of methamphet-
amine and approximately 27.5 grams of
heroin. Carter and Colschen were arrested
and their cell phones were confiscated. The
police later obtained a warrant to search
the cell phones.

[5] Carter was brought to trial on
charges of Dealing in a Narcotic Drug and
Dealing in Methamphetamine, both as
Level 2 felonies. The State also alleged
that Carter was a habitual offender. Be-
fore the trial began, Carter moved to sup-
press evidence obtained from the search of
his cell phone; the trial court denied Car-
ter’s motion. At trial, Carter objected to
the admission of cell phone evidence, and
the court held a conference outside the
presence of the jury. At the conference,
the State tendered an exhibit containing
several pages of text messages. The court
determined that eight messages were ad-
missible, and that, among the eight, any
messages from third parties were admissi-

ble only to give context to Carter’s mes-
sages. The State prepared a redacted ex-
hibit containing the eight admissible text
messages. See State’s Ex. 23-1. Those
messages—later admitted with a limiting
instruction—indicated that Carter met
with three individuals in the hours preced-
ing the traffic stop, and had instructed one
individual to pull around to the back, be-
hind his Mustang, to avoid being seen.

[6] The State’s evidence also included
testimony from Detective James Budde
(“Detective Budde”), who was assigned to
the local drug task force and had encoun-
tered heroin and methamphetamine hun-
dreds of times as a police officer. Detective
Budde opined that the quantity of heroin
seized was “typical of a dealer amount,” to
which Carter did not object. Tr. Vol. IV at
224.

[7] The jury found Carter guilty of the
dealing counts, and Carter admitted to
being a habitual offender. Following a sen-
tencing hearing, the trial court imposed an
aggregate sentence of thirty-six years in
the Indiana Department of Correction.

[8] Carter now appeals.
Discussion and Decision

Cell Phone Records

[1-3] [9] Carter frames his argument
as a challenge to the denial of his motion
to suppress evidence, but Carter did not
seek interlocutory review of that denial.
We therefore treat Carter’s argument as a
challenge to the admission of the evidence.
See Carpenter v. State, 18 N.E.3d 998,
1001 (Ind. 2014). “The trial court has

5. The Fourth Amendment provides: ‘The
right of the people to be secure in their per-
sons, houses, papers, and effects, against un-
reasonable searches and seizures, shall not be
violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but
upon probable cause, supported by Oath or
affirmation, and particularly describing the
place to be searched, and the persons or
things to be seized.”

broad discretion to rule on the admissibili-
ty of evidence.” Thomas v. State, 81
N.E.3d 621, 624 (Ind. 2017). Ordinarily, we
review evidentiary rulings for an abuse of
discretion, evaluating whether the court’s
ruling was “clearly against the logic and
effect of the facts and circumstances.” Id.
“However, when a challenge ... is predi-
cated on the constitutionality of the search
or seizure of evidence, it raises a question
of law that we review de novo.” Id.

[4] [10] Both the Fourth Amendment
to the United States Constitution and Arti-
cle 1, Section 11 of the Indiana Constitu-
tion proscribe unreasonable searches of
“persons, houses, papers, and effects.” *
Moreover, under the Fourth Amendment,
“reasonableness generally requires the ob-
taining of a judicial warrant.” Vernonia
School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646,
658, 115 S.Ct. 2386, 132 L.Ed.2d 564
(1995).

[5,6] [11] There are a few “specifically
established and well-delineated exceptions”
to the warrant requirement. Katz v. Unit-
ed States, 389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S.Ct. 507,
19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967). Among those excep-
tions “is a search incident to a lawful ar-
rest,” Arizona v. Gant, 556 U.S. 332, 338,
129 S.Ct. 1710, 173 L.Ed.2d 485 (2009),
whereby the Fourth Amendment permits
“a warrantless search of the arrestee’s
person and the area ‘within his immediate
control,” Davis v. United States, 564 U.S.
229, 232, 131 S.Ct. 2419, 180 L.Ed.2d 285
(2011) (quoting Chimel v. California, 395
US. 752, 763, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d

Using nearly identical language, Article 1,
Section 11 of the Indiana Constitution pro-
vides: ‘‘The right of the people to be secure in
their persons, houses, papers, and effects,
against unreasonable search or seizure, shall
not be violated; and no warrant shall issue,
but upon probable cause, supported by oath
or affirmation, and particularly describing the
place to be searched, and the person or thing
to be seized.”

685 (1969) ). Under this exception, officers
generally may search the containers they
encounter. See United States v. Robinson,
414 USS. 218, 236, 94 S.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d
427 (1973) (determining that the Fourth
Amendment permitted a search of a pack-
age of cigarettes that was found during a
search incident to arrest); cf Garcia v.
State, 47 N.E.3d 1196, 1205 (Ind. 2016)
(Under Article 1, Section 11, opening a
container found on the person of an arres-
tee in the course of a search incident to
{alvalid arrest will not automatically be
deemed unreasonable.”).

[12] However, as the United States Su-
preme Court noted in Riley v. California,
“(a] search of the information on a cell
phone bears little resemblance to the ...
brief physical search” of a container found
on an arrestee’s person. — U.S. —, 134
S.Ct. 2473, 2485, 189 L.Ed.2d 430 (2014).
Namely, modern cell phones—as a “partic-
ular category of effects” subject to Fourth
Amendment protection, id. at 2485—“im-
plicate privacy concerns far beyond those
implicated by the search of a cigarette
pack, a wallet, or a purse.” Jd. at 2488-89.
“Indeed, a cell phone search would typical-
ly expose to the government far more than
the most exhaustive search of a house.” Jd.
at 2491 (emphasis removed). In view of
these privacy concerns, the Riley Court
concluded that “officers must generally se-
cure a warrant” before searching a cell
phone. Jd. at 2485.

[13] Recently, the United States Su-
preme Court addressed similar privacy
concerns in deciding Carpenter v. United
States, No. 16-402, 585 U.S. —, 138 S.Ct.
2206, 201 L.Ed.2d 507, 2018 WL 3073916
(June 22, 2018). There, law enforcement
had obtained, without a warrant, location-
related data from an individual’s wireless
carrier’s cell-site record that the cell phone

6. At oral argument, Carter conceded that
there was probable cause to issue a search
warrant. However, we must engage in some

had logged “by dint of its operation.” Id. at
*12, ——, 138 S.Ct. 2206. The Court re-
jected arguments that the information was
rendered less private because it was part
of business records or because, by using
the phone, the individual had technically
disclosed the location information to the
wireless carrier. Jd. at *11-12, ——-——,
138 S.Ct. 2206. The Court reflected on the
“unique nature of cell phone location rec-
ords,” id. at *9, ——, 188 S.Ct. 2206, and
ultimately concluded “that the Government
must generally obtain a warrant supported
by probable cause before acquiring such
records,” id. at * 13, ——, 138 S.Ct. 2206.

[14] Here, unlike in Riley and Carpen-
ter, the police secured a warrant before
searching the cell phone data. Thus, we
must look beyond these cases to resolve
the issue Carter presents—which is wheth-
er the warrant was defective, rendering
the evidence unconstitutionally obtained
and, thereby, inadmissible.

Probable Cause

[7-12] [15] As an initial matter, for a
valid warrant to issue, the police must first
set forth probable cause to conduct the
search. U.S. Const. amend. IV; Ind.
Const. art. 1, § 11; I.C. §§ 35-33-5-2, -8
(codifying constitutional principles and es-
tablishing requirements for affidavits or
other testimony in support of search war-
rants). Probable cause is a “fluid concept
incapable of precise definition ... [and] is
to be decided based on the facts of each
case.” Figert v. State, 686 N.E.2d 827, 830
(Ind. 1997). In determining whether a po-
lice affidavit sets forth probable cause “to
issue a search warrant, ‘[t]he task of the
issuing magistrate is simply to make a
practical, common-sense decision whether,
given all the circumstances set forth in the
affidavit ... there is a fair probability that

discussion of probable cause, as the topic
informs other aspects of our analysis.

contraband or evidence of a crime will be
found in a particular place.’” State v. Spil-
lers, 847 N.E.2d 949, 952-53 (Ind. 2006)
(quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213,
238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527
(1983) ).7 Put differently, the central ques-
tion in a probable cause determination is
whether the affidavit presents facts, to-
gether with reasonable inferences, demon-
strating a sufficient nexus between the
suspected criminal activity and the specific
place to be searched. See Eaton v. State,
889 N.E.2d 297, 300 (Ind. 2008); Figert,
686 N.E.2d at 830 (determining that a
warrant to search a residence was not
supported by probable cause where the
underlying affidavit indicated that drug
sales occurred in two residences that were
merely nearby the residence to be
searched, and that unidentified individuals
had frequented all three residences).

[13] [16] Here, law enforcement sought
a warrant to search the cell phone for
evidence of the crime of dealing metham-
phetamine. As to suspected criminal activi-
ty, the affiant stated that the police found
a baggie inside Carter’s co-owned vehicle
that contained a substance field-tested to
be methamphetamine, with a field weight
of 207 grams. The affiant also stated that,
based on training and experience, metham-
phetamine is typically purchased in one-
gram quantities, and that the quantity in
the vehicle was consistent with dealing
activity. The affiant further stated that
another baggie in the vehicle contained an
amount of heroin consistent with drug
dealing. As to the cell phone, the affidavit
stated that the phone was recovered from

7. Upon a challenge to whether probable
cause supported the issuance of a search war-
rant, ‘[t]he duty of the reviewing court is to
determine whether the magistrate had a ‘sub-

Carter, and that those involved in drug
activity primarily use cell phones and elec-
tronic devices to communicate with one
another through calls, text messages, and
applications such as Facebook.

[17] In Haton, law enforcement had ob-
tained evidence that the defendant was
involved in drug-trafficking activity taking
place at a muffler shop. 889 N.E.2d at 299.
In the affidavit in support of a search
warrant for the defendant’s home, the affi-
ant set forth factual background regarding
the defendant’s connection to the drug
trafficking. Id. The affiant also “stated that
drug traffickers commonly keep U.S. cur-
rency within quick access and maintain
records in a variety of forms including
ledgers, computers, cell phones, pagers,
phone bills, and wire transfer receipts.” Id.
at 300 (internal quotation marks omitted).
It does not appear that the affiant specifi-
cally stated that drug traffickers typically
kept such records at their residences. See
id. Nonetheless, in resolving Eaton, our
supreme court upheld the underlying prob-
able cause determination, concluding that
the affidavit presented “facts showing that
the defendant was involved in drug traf-
ficking” along with “facts and reasonable
inferences establishing a fair probability
that records and equipment related to such
drug trafficking were likely to be found in
the defendant’s home.” Jd. In so conclud-
ing, the Court observed that “other courts

believe that drug dealers keep evidence of

[18] Examining the instant case in light
of Eaton, here, the supporting affidavit
even more directly set forth the nexus
between the asserted criminal activity—
dealing methamphetamine—and the place
to be searched—the cell phone, through
which dealers typically communicate con-
cerning their illegal activity. Thus, the affi-
davit provided a substantial basis for de-
termining that probable cause existed to
support the issuance of a warrant to
search the phone. Yet, underlying probable
cause is not the only facet of a constitu-
tional warrant.

Particularity

[14] [19] In addition to requiring
probable cause, both the United States
Constitution and the Indiana Constitution
provide that a warrant must contain a
particular description of the place to be
searched and the persons or things to be
seized. U.S. Const. amend. IV; Ind. Const.
art. 1, § 11. This particularity require-
ment “ensures that the search will be
carefully tailored to its justifications, and
will not take on the character of the wide-
ranging exploratory searches the Framers
intended to prohibit.” Maryland v. Garri-
son, 480 U.S. 79, 84, 107 S.Ct. 1013, 94
L.Ed.2d 72 (1987). Indeed, the require-
ment aims to prevent “a general, explor-
atory rummaging in a person’s belong-
ings.” Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403
US. 443, 467, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d
564 (1971).

[15-20] [20] Although the warrant
must describe “with some specificity”
where officers are to search and what they
are to seize, “there is no requirement that
there be an exact description.” Overstreet
v. State, 783 N.E.2d 1140, 1158 (Ind. 2003).
Nonetheless, the warrant must be specific
enough so that officers can, “with reason-
able effort,” ascertain the place to be
searched and the items to be seized. Steele
v. United States, 267 U.S. 498, 503, 45
S.Ct. 414, 69 L.Ed. 757 (1925). This re-

quirement “prevents the seizure of one
thing under a warrant describing another.
As to what is to be taken, nothing is left to
the discretion of the officer executing the
warrant.” Marron v. United States, 275
U.S. 192, 198, 48 S.Ct. 74, 72 L.Ed. 231
(1927); see also Griffith v. State, 59 N.E.3d
947, 958 (Ind. 2016) (observing that a suffi-
cient description avoids giving the police
unbridled discretion). Ultimately, the de-
scription in a search warrant should “ ‘be
as particular as circumstances permit.”
State v. Foy, 862 N.E.2d 1219, 1227 (Ind.
Ct. App. 2007) (quoting United States v.
Lievertz, 247 F.Supp.2d 1052, 1062 (S.D.
Ind. 2002) ). Moreover, to satisfy the par-
ticularity requirement, it is permissible if a
warrant incorporates by reference certain
supporting documents—such as the proba-
ble cause affidavit—that collectively
“serv[e] to identify the scope of ... items
that could properly be seized.” Membres v.
State, 889 N.E.2d 265, 276 (Ind. 2008).

[21] Here, the warrant authorized
searching the phone for:
fruits, instrumentalities and evidence
pertaining to the crime(s) of DEALING,
POSSESSION and/or CONSPIRACY
TO COMMIT DEALING OR POSSES-
SION OF METHAMPHETAMINE, as
more particularly described as follows:
[] Permission to search the above de-
scribed phone for any information relat-
ing to calls, messages, including Face-
book messages and accounts, and all
information including but not limited to
photographs, images, emails, letters, ap-
plications, and folders as well as any
messages that may be stored on the
phone that would indicate the identity
of the phone’s owner/user and permis-
sion to view and copy said information if
deemed necessary for preservation.

ed).
[22] Carter asserts that the warrant au-
thorized a broad search of his device for

all information that might supply indicia
of ownership, rendering the warrant an
impermissible general warrant. Carter
points out that the police extracted “all
the information on the cell phone,” there-
by generating “a document of roughly a
thousand pages, which was then analyzed
for criminal activity.” Appellant’s Br. at
16-17. Directing our attention to the pri-
vacy concerns articulated in Riley, Carter
essentially argues that a warrant is uncon-
stitutionally general where it permits law
enforcement to review all the information
on a cell phone to look for indicia of iden-
tity of the phone’s owner.’

[21] [23] However, the warrant specifi-
cally described the place law enforcement
could search—the phone recovered from
Carter—and specifically described what
law enforcement could search for—(1)
“any information relating to calls, mes-
sages, including Facebook messages and
accounts,” and (2) “all information ... that
would indicate the identity of the phone’s
owner/user.” Pre-trial Hearing Exhibit 1.
Moreover, the first clause permitting the
search for calls and messages enjoys a
close nexus to the probable cause that
justified issuing the search warrant—
which is that Carter was a suspected drug
dealer, and drug dealers use cell phones to
communicate with others involved in illicit
drug activity. See Eaton, 889 N.E.2d at
300. Thus, this aspect of the search war-
rant was “tailored to its justifications.”
Maryland, 480 U.S. at 84, 107 S.Ct. 1013.

[22] [24] In carrying out the search,
law enforcement did extract more than one

but that case did not involve an insufficiently
particular search warrant. Rather, in Ogburn,
this Court determined that a warrant was not
supported by probable cause and that, in the
alternative, the ensuing search “clearly ex-
ceeded the scope of the warrant.” 53 N.E.3d

thousand pages of information using a
“logical extraction” device that created an
“auto generated” report of the file archi-
tecture on the phone. Tr. Vol. IV at 142-
43. Although Carter draws our attention to
the quantity of data extracted, he has not
demonstrated that there was any other
way to practically conduct the permitted
search. As the State observes, “[a] great
deal of other information will likely have to
be sifted through in order to find the
relevant information—similar to looking
through drawers in a home or office file
cabinet for specific files or letters that are
relevant to the investigation.” Appellee’s
Br. at 15. Ultimately, we discern no indica-
tion that law enforcement had the ability
to determine, ex ante, that certain pages
could not have contained any of the infor-
mation sought. See United States v. Sta-
bile, 633 F.3d 219, 238 (8d Cir. 2011) (“ ‘[A]
computer search may be as extensive as
reasonably required to locate the items
described in the warrant’ based on proba-
ble cause.” (quoting United States v.
Grimmett, 439 F.3d 1263, 1270 (10th Cir.
2006) ); Wheeler v. State, 135 A.3d 282, 301
(Del. 2016) (“Some irrelevant files may
have to be at least cursorily perused to
determine whether they are within the
authorized search ambit.”).

[23, 24] [25] With respect to Carter’s
assertion that the second clause was im-
permissibly general—that is, the clause
permitting a search for all indicia of own-
ership of the phone—the challenged evi-
dence consisted only of text messages. As-
suming arguendo that the second clause
was insufficiently particular, even where a

at 474. To the extent Ogburn comments on

ta. See Koske v. Townsend Eng’g Co., 551

not necessary in the determination of the is-
sues presented ... are not binding and do not

portion of a search warrant is too general,
the Indiana Supreme Court has explained
that “[t]he infirmity ... does not doom the
entire warrant.” Warren v. State, 760
N.E.2d 608, 610 (Ind. 2002). Rather, the
infirmity requires “only ... suppression of
the evidence seized pursuant to that part
of the warrant but not the suppression of
the evidence obtained pursuant to the valid
specific portions of the warrant.” Id. (cit-
ing United States v. Greene, 250 F.3d 471,
A477 (6th Cir. 2001) and United States v.
Reed, 726 F.2d 339, 342 (7th Cir. 1984) );
see also United States v. Galpin, 720 F.3d
436, 448-50 (2d Cir. 2013). Here, the chal-
lenged text messages were seized pursuant
to the other, specific portion of the war-
rant that authorized searching the phone
for messages.?

[26] Based on the foregoing, we conclude
that the challenged text messages were
not seized pursuant to an impermissible
general warrant. Therefore, the court did
not abuse its discretion by admitting the
text messages over Carter’s objection.

Reasonableness

[25, 26] [27] Carter briefly argues that
the search was unreasonable under Article
1, Section 11 of the Indiana Constitution.
Under the Indiana Constitution, the legali-
ty of a search “turns on an evaluation of
the reasonableness of the police conduct
under the totality of the circumstances.”
Litchfield v. State, 824 N.E.2d 356, 359
(Ind. 2005). In evaluating the reasonable-
ness of a search, we balance three factors:
(1) the degree of suspicion of unlawful

9. At oral argument, there was some discus-
sion about the possibility of officers coming
across evidence of a different crime while
combing through electronic files pursuant to
a warrant. Because the case before us does
not present such facts, our opinion does not
extend to that hypothetical situation. See Sny-
der v. King, 958 N.E.2d 764, 786 (Ind. 2011)
(observing that courts should decide cases
“only on the specific facts of the particular
case and not on hypothetical situations’’).

activity; (2) the degree of intrusion the
method of the search imposes on the citi-
zen’s ordinary activities; and (3) the extent
of law enforcement needs. Jd. at 361.

[27] [28] Here, the search did not
greatly intrude upon Carter’s activities.
Nonetheless, the search was intrusive in
nature, as it involved searching a personal
cell phone—a device that often contains
highly personal information. However, law
enforcement had located contraband in
Carter’s vehicle—specifically, a quantity of
methamphetamine with a street value
around $20,000 and a quantity of heroin
with a street value between $9,000 and
$12,000. Thus, law enforcement had a high
degree of suspicion of unlawful activity.
Furthermore, searching the phone ad-
vanced law enforcement needs related to
identifying drug-dealing activity and pro-
tecting the community from the hazards of
methamphetamine and heroin. On balance,
we conclude that the search was reason-
able under the totality of the circum-
stances.

Opinion Testimony

[28-30] [29] Carter argues that the tri-
al court abused its discretion by admitting
testimony from Detective Budde, who
opined that the quantity of heroin seized
was “typical of a dealer amount.” Tr. Vol.
IV at 224. Because Carter failed to raise a
contemporaneous objection, Carter’s only
available argument with respect to admis-
sion of the testimony is that the admission
constituted fundamental error.’ See, eg.,

Nonetheless, we expect that existing caselaw
provides ample analogues should this issue
arise in the electronic context. See, e.g., Over-
street, 783 N.E.2d at 1160 (determining that
the plain view doctrine permitted the seizure
of evidence that officers came across while
carrying out a valid search warrant).

10. In his Appellant's Brief, Carter states that
the evidence was admitted over his objection.
However, the record indicates that no objec-
1132 Ind.

Brown v. State, 929 N.E.2d 204, 207 (Ind.
2010). Yet, Carter declined to argue funda-
mental error, despite the opportunity to do
so. Thus, Carter has waived any funda-
mental-error argument. See Ferguson v.
State, 40 N.E.3d 954, 957 (Ind. Ct. App.
2015), trans. denied. Waiver notwithstand-
ing, Carter argues that Detective Budde’s
testimony was inadmissible because it was
inaccurate and contrary to law.” To the
extent Carter’s argument involves statuto-
ry interpretation, we interpret statutes de
novo. Johnson v. State, 87 N.E.3d 471, 472
(Ind. 2017).

[30] Carter directs us to Indiana Code
Section 35-48-4-1(a)(2), which criminalizes
the possession of heroin with the intent to
deliver the drug. Under the statutory
framework, an individual can be convicted
of dealing under either of two circum-
stances: (1) if the amount possessed is at
least twenty-eight grams or (2) “there is
evidence in addition to the weight of the
drug that the person intended to ... deliv-
er ... the drug.” LC. § 35-48-4-1(b).
Here, the amount of heroin was less than
twenty-eight grams, and so a conviction
required additional evidence of Carter’s
intent to deliver the heroin. See id.

[31] [81] According to Carter, the very
existence of the twenty-eight-gram pre-
sumption precludes the admission of testi-

tion was made at the time the evidence was
admitted, and it does not appear that the trial
court entered a continuing objection that
would have preserved the issue. See, e.g., Kin-
dred v. State, 524 N.E.2d 279, 292 (Ind. 1988).

11. In its brief, the State pointed out that Car-
ter had failed to raise a contemporaneous
objection and had not argued fundamental
error on appeal. Thereafter, Carter did not
argue fundamental error in his Reply Brief.

12. In a footnote, Carter briefly asserts that
Detective Budde was not qualified to give
opinion testimony as a skilled witness pursu-
ant to Indiana Evidence Rule 701. At oral
argument, however, Carter conceded that De-

105 NORTH EASTERN REPORTER, 3d SERIES

mony indicating that less heroin could con-
stitute a “dealer quantity” of heroin. He
argues that “[t]he legislature has made a
decision about the quantity of drug which
may be interpreted as presumptive of deal-
ing, and the officer has rendered an opin-
ion that is contrary to what the legislature
found.” Reply Br. at 6. However, we con-
clude that the statute does not operate to
bar admission of probative evidence relat-
ed to the defendant’s intent to deal the
drug. Rather, the statute eliminates the
State’s burden of presenting additional in-
tent evidence when there is evidence that
the drug weighed at least twenty-eight
grams. Put another way, once the State
has introduced evidence that the defendant
possessed the statutory amount, there is
sufficient evidence to establish the defen-
dant’s intent to deliver the drug. Yet, the
State is not foreclosed from presenting
additional evidence of intent, and the stat-
utory framework does not otherwise affect
the admissibility of evidence of intent
where, as here, the quantity possessed is
less than twenty-eight grams."

[82] Thus, we conclude that the trial
court did not err by admitting the chal-
lenged testimony.

Conclusion

[83] The court did not abuse its discre-
tion by admitting text messages procured

tective Budde was qualified to give the opin-
ion testimony, but maintained that the legisla-
ture preempted the particular type of opinion
testimony due to the framework of the statute
at issue.

13. Moreover, it is not as though the weight
and weight-based opinion testimony constitut-
ed the only evidence indicative of Carter’s
intent to deliver the heroin. Rather, the evi-
dence indicated that Carter possessed multi-
ple types of drugs with a collective street
value around $30,000, and that he had met
with several individuals prior to the traffic
stop, at one point instructing an individual to
covertly pull behind his vehicle.

(1) trial court did not abuse its discretion
in admitting results of chemical breath
test and police officers’ testimony re-

(2) imposition of five-year sentence was
not inappropriate in light of the nature
of offenses and defendant’s character;
and

(3) trial court impermissibly imposed a
separate sentence based on HVSO
finding.
